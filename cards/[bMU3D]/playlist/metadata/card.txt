Author:: Tumble Media
Description:: Yoga Kids Adventure is a kids’ yoga podcast for stretching your body and imagination. Come with us and step into your next yoga adventure! All you need is your ears, your imagination, and a safe place to move. Host and kids’ yoga teacher Kathryn invites young yogis to join her on creative journeys through movement – no screens needed. Stretch out with a morning swim at the beach, or calm your body before bedtime in a cozy bear cave. Wiggle with wild animals on a safari or lift off from your chair as you breathe and bend among the stars. Return to these routines as many times as you want, and do them anywhere that you want! This podcast brings free family yoga to you in your living room, classroom, and even outdoors without being tied to a screen. Yoga Kids Adventure is centered around mindfulness, imaginative play, and physical activity. With audio yoga adventure stories ranging from 5 to 15 minutes, it’s a way to make kids’ yoga part of your every day.
