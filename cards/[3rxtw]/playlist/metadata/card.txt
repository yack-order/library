Title:: Santa in the City
Author:: Tiffany D. Jackson
Description:: A little girl's belief in Santa is restored in this ode to the magic of Christmas. This is a holiday gift readers will treasure for years to come!  It's two weeks before Christmas, and Deja is worried that Santa might not be able to visit her--after all, as a city kid, she doesn't have a chimney for him to come down and none of the parking spots on her block could fit a sleigh, let alone eight reindeer! But with a little help from her family, community, and Santa himself, Deja discovers that the Christmas spirit is alive and well in her city.   With warm, lively narration that captures the joy of the holidays, this adapted-for-audio picture book from award-winning author Tiffany D. Jackson is not to be missed.
