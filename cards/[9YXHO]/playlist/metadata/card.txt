"Breakfast Club guaranteed I had the best possible start to my day and welcomed me with open arms. It wasnâ€™t just about food. It was about forming friendships, about togetherness, about escape. It was where some of my greatest memories were made. I want to capture that feeling in my debut fiction book." - Marcus Rashford MBE
