Title:: Mystery of the Burnt Cottage
Author:: Enid Blyton
Description:: Someone has set fire to Mr Hick's cottage, but who could it be? Fatty, Larry, Daisy, Pip, Bets and Buster the dog have their very first case to solve. But it's not easy being detectives with policeman Mr Goon telling them to 'clear orf'. The Find-Outers are determined - they have to solve the mystery before Mr Goon does!   In the original 1943 text, Fatty's nickname is based on the fact that his initials are F.A.T. as well as his size. All references to his size have been removed from this recording (based on the text from 2016) so that Fatty's nickname refers to his initials only.
