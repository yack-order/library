Title:: Chrysanthemum
Author:: Kevin Henkes

This is an ideal break-the-ice audiobook for the first week of school. It get children thinking about and bonding with their own names and the names of everyone else in the class, and it's the perfect vehicle for starting a discussion about treating classmates with tolerance, kindness, and compassion.
