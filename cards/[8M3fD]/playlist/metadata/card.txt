Title:: Monsters University
Author:: Disney Pixar
Description:: The hilarious story of how two mismatched monsters met and became lifelong friends in a story screaming with laughter and oozing with heart. Ever since college-bound Mike Wazowski was a little monster, he’s dreamed of becoming a Scarer -- and he knows better than anyone that the best Scarers come from Monsters University (MU). 

But during his first semester at MU, Mike’s plans are derailed when he crosses paths with hotshot James P. Sullivan, “Sulley”, a natural-born Scarer. The pair’s out-of-control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the University's elite Scare Program. 

With their dreams temporarily dashed, they learn they will have to work together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever hope to make things right.
