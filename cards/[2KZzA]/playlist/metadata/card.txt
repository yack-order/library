Title:: Ribsy
Author:: Beverly Cleary
Description:: Good ol' Ribsy's ever-curious mind has always gotten him into trouble, but this time he may have gone too far. After a comical turn of events, Ribsy finds himself in the wrong station wagon with the wrong children.

Ribsy will do anything to find Henry, but there's plenty of excitement to be had along the way--and scoring a touchdown for a local high school team is only part of the fun!
