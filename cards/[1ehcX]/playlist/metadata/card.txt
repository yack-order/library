Title:: Mama and Mommy and Me in the Middle
Author:: Nina LaCour
Description:: For one little girl, there’s no place she’d rather be than sitting between Mama and Mommy. So when Mommy goes away on a work trip, it’s tricky to find a good place at the table. As the days go by, Mama brings her to the library, they watch movies, and all of them talk on the phone, but she still misses Mommy as deep as the ocean and as high as an astronaut up in the stars. As they pass by a beautiful garden, the girl gets an idea...but when Mommy finally comes home, it takes a minute to shake off the empty feeling she felt all week before leaning in for a kiss.
