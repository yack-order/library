Meet MC Growls, wannabe rapper and star of the show in this hilarious and heartwarming teen debut. Shaun (aka MC Growls) is ready to drop his best bars and smash the competition at Raptology. That way, he's convinced Tanisha will finally give him a chance.  But when a livestream practice goes epically wrong, Growls's dirty laundry is literally exposed. He's finally achieved his dreams of going viral - not in the good way. Now Tanisha won't look at him, he's the joke of the school and there's no way he can show his face at the competition. Will he ever catch a break?  Then a new girl on the block appears who might be just the friend Growls needs. Especially when she points out that Raptology could be the answer to his problems after all...  
Step up to the mic! It's MC Growls and he's ready for this. He's steady for this. It's comeback season and they call him comeback king for a reason.  

A hilarious debut from breakout star Nathanael Lessore, perfect for teen readers of Alex Wheatle and Jason Reynolds.
