Description:: Hello, and welcome to part six in this series on Make Your Own on Yoto. 

The next thing to cover about Make Your Own on Yoto is that itâ€™s made for sharing. When you have created something you like, you can share it with friends and family so they can listen to it as well. And, an important thing to know, if you update the audio on that card, it will update for whoever you share it with as well.

In this activity, we will learn how to share a playlist with a friend, and all we will need is the Yoto App.
