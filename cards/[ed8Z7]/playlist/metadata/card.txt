Title:: Lost on Infinity
Author:: Rockford's Rock Opera
Description:: Far away in the Sea of Tranquility is the Island of Infinity, home to the world's lost creatures. Infinity has a secret for the world but Moog, a boy from Battersea in London, and Rockford his dog are the only ones who can deliver its message. Travelling to Infinity, Moog and Rockford are drawn into an adventure that threatens the entire human race.

At its heart Lost on Infinity, the first adventure from Rockford's Rock Opera, is a tale about extinction. But it's a hopeful story that shows that even the smallest creatures, and humans, can make the biggest difference.

An award-winning, psychedelic, spell-binding, thought provoking 21st Century adventure!
