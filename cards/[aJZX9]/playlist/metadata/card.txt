Title:: Road Trip Rescue
Author:: Becca Wierwille
Description:: A heartwarming adventure for kids ages 8-12 with a missing dog, a determined girl, a pink-haired aunt, and themes of faith and friendship.

Twelve-year-old Kimmy trusts dogs more than people. 

After all, her dog Bo never made fun of her for having one hand. But two years ago, Bo disappeared. 

When Kimmy stumbles across a magazine photo of a dog in upstate New York that looks just like Bo, she knows she has to find him. Her parents seem oddly unsupportive, but pink-haired, adventure-hungry Aunt Skylar agrees to a road trip with a stop in the Adirondacks. Kimmy jumps at the chance to bring her furry family member home. 

Unfortunately, Aunt Skylar’s idea of a road trip isn’t the rescue mission Kimmy had in mind.
