Title:: The Disaster Detectives
Author:: Joseph Edward Degnan and Katie Sparks
Description:: Icebergs. Earthquakes. A mysterious, three-sided no-man’s land at sea that swallows up ships, planes, and people—without leaving a trace!

What do all these things have in common? They all play a part in some of the worst disasters in history.

After a disaster, experts are called in to investigate and report. This means establishing timelines, gathering evidence, and, when possible, recording eyewitness testimony. Join Disaster Detectives Joseph and Katie as they comb through their Disaster Dossier to find out what happened and discover the brilliant solutions humans have developed to help predict, prevent, or respond to future disasters!

Based on the best-selling book Real-life Disasters by Susan Martineau, The Disaster Detectives takes a reassuring approach and promotes curiosity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. 

Great for investigators ages 7 and up. Visit us at TheDisasterDetectives.com to learn more!
