Title:: Dirty Beasts NEW
Author:: Roald Dahl
Description:: Brought to you by Penguin.    

Dirty Beasts is narrated by poet, actor and comedian, Tim Key, and is bursting with fantabulous sound effects.    

A collection of (mainly) grisly beasts out for human blood, ranging from Crocky-Wock the crocodile to Stingaling the scorpion, described in verse with all Dahl's usual gusto. Was that CROCKY-WOCK galumphing up the stairs?  Is STINGALING hiding in your bed? And what foul fate has PIGGY planned for Farmer Bland? WARNING! This book contains wickedly funny verse, prickly surprises and the most despicable creatures you could ever hope (not) to meet.    

The text in this edition of Dirty Beasts was updated in 2022 for young independent readers.
