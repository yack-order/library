Title:: Funny Bones: Posada and His Day of the Dead Calaveras (Digital)
Author:: Duncan Tonatiuh
Description:: Funny Bones tells the story of how the amusing calaveras-skeletons performing various everyday or festive activities-came to be. They are the creation of Mexican artist Jose Guadalupe (Lupe) Posada (1852-1913). In a country that was not known for freedom of speech, he first drew political cartoons, much to the amusement of the local population but not the politicians. He continued to draw cartoons throughout much of his life, but he is best known today for his calavera drawings. They have become synonymous with Mexico's Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) festival.
