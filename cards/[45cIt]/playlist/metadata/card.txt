Author:: Worship for Everyone
Description:: Worship For Everyone – the all age worship movement hailing from the UK – releases a  new album titled “Breathe.” Made up of Nick and Becky Drake, parents to four children  themselves, Worship For Everyone has been ministering to kids in church groups and  schools for years. 

From their extensive experience, they recognised a need for worship  songs that create an atmosphere of stillness, which they offer through the ten songs on  “Breathe.”  “Knowing that so many children have enjoyed our songs over the years, we wanted to  create an album that would still feel familiar to our listeners, but with a totally different  feel,” they share. “Breathe” is sonically spacious, creating an opportunity for families to enjoy peaceful,  reflective, and meditative moments together with simple and beautiful worship. “We hope these songs will bless every generation, creating and serving those quieter  moments that we need and often long for. We hope above all that people of all ages will  be able to draw comfort and sustenance from God as these songs minister to them,”  they conclude. 

Worship For Everyone’s new album speaks to an anxious generation, reminding them to  catch their breath and slow down, but also of the Breath of God who made and restores them.
