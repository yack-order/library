Title:: A Different Sort of Normal (Digital)
Author:: Abigail Balfe
Description:: The beautiful true story of one girl's journey growing up autistic - and the challenges she faced in the 'normal' world.    

I'm not like the other children in my class . . . and that's an actual scientific FACT.    

Hi! My name is Abigail, and I'm autistic. But I didn't know I was autistic until I was an adult-sort-of-person*.    

This is my true story of growing up in the confusing 'normal' world, all the while missing some Very Important Information about myself.    

There'll be scary moments involving toilets and crowded trains, heart-warming tales of cats and pianos, and funny memories including my dad and a mysterious tub of ice cream. Along the way you'll also find some Very Crucial Information about autism.    

If you've ever felt different, out of place, like you don't fit in . . . this audiobook is for you.   

*I've never really felt like an actual-adult-person, as you'll soon discover in this audiobook...    

Told through the author's remarkable words, this is the book for those who've never felt quite right in the 'normal' world.
