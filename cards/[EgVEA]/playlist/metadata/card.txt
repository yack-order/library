Title:: Spy Club: Mission - Bring Back Boyd Card 1
Author:: Yoto
Description:: After long, boring lessons on a wet Wednesday afternoon, Jane, Ollie, Zora, and Rohan race to Mr. Boyd’s class room for Spy Club, but he’s not at his desk, or staring at his globe like he loves to do. He’s not there, and neither is the globe. He’s gone. Mr. Boyd’s classroom has been stripped bare – except for a small package sitting on his desk, right in the middle.

Inside, the kids find two key cards - Lumera Technologies and Lumera Operations, along with four worksheets covered in cryptic scribbles and hidden codes, a business card with circular and rectangular cutouts and a red reveal card. 

Spy Club need to work together to figure out what they have to do, and where they have to go. 
Their adventure begins. Trade Craft beckons…

Are your kids stuck on the mission?? Head to Spy Club HQ on Yoto Space to ask for help and swap tips with other families looking to give their kids a helping hint.

PLEASE NOTE: This pack requires a Yoto Player or Yoto Mini and the physical Spy Pack to play this interactive audio game. Without them, listeners will not be able to decipher clues and take action like a true spy.
