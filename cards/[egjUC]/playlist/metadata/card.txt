Title:: The Dinosaur That Pooped a Princess
Author:: Dougie Poynter and Tom Fletcher
Description:: Danny and Dinosaur are convinced that a damsel in distress needs their help… the only problem is, they aren’t sure where she actually is. So they set off through Fairy Tale Land to track her down, but things don’t go exactly to plan… Can Dinosaur make it through Fairy Tale Land without eating everything in sight? And do all princesses really need to be rescued? Packed with prehistoric cheekiness, punchy girl power and, of course, lots and lots of poop!
