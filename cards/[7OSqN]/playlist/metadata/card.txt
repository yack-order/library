Title:: What If World - Stories for Kids
Author:: Eric O'Keeffe
Description:: What if a tiny dragon lived in my closet? What if there were a never-ending bowl of ice cream? What if cats ruled the world? Pirates, fairies, wizards, robots and more band together to help Mr. Eric tell wacky stories inspired by kids’ questions.

Mr. Eric believes that curiosity and hope go hand in hand. Children who keep wondering can thrive when faced with new ideas and challenges. What If World’s progressive stories aim to keep kids laughing and learning well into adulthood.
