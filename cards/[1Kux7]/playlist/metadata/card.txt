Esio Trot is narrated by actor, presenter and comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar OBE (The Kumars, Absolutely Anything, Unforgotten), and is bursting with fantabulous sound effects. 

'I do actually happen to know how to make tortoises grow faster, if that's really what you want.'

Mr Hoppy really loves his neighbour Mrs Silver, and Mrs Silver really loves her tortoise, Alfie. Oh, if only Mr Hoppy could perform some great feat that would make him a hero in her eyes! Then one day an amazing idea rushes into his head. With the help of a magical spell, some cabbage leaves and one hundred and forty tortoises, can shy Mr Hoppy win Mrs Silver's heart?

The text in this edition of Esio Trot was updated in 2022 for young independent readers.
