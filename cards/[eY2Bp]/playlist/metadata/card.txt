Title:: Llama Llama Mad at Mama
Author:: Anna Dewdney
Description:: Yucky music, great big feet.
 
Ladies smelling way too sweet.
 
Look at knees and stand in line.
 
Llama Llama starts to whine.
 
Does any child like to go shopping? Not Llama Llama! But Mama can't leave Llama at home, so off they go to Shop-O-Rama. Lots of aisles. Long lines. Mama is too busy to notice that Llama Llama is getting m-a-d! And before he knows it, he's having a full-out tantrum! Mama quickly calms him down, but she also realizes that they need to make shopping more fun for both of them. Parents and children are sure to recognize themselves in this fun-to-listen to follow-up to the popular Llama Llama Red Pajama.
