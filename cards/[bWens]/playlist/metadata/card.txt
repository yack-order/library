Title:: Focus on Flow
Author:: LifeScore Music
Description:: LifeScore Cards are immersive soundscapes that encourage a calm state of mind. Each card contains an hour-long piece of music (playing in loop) composed by world-class composers and played by legendary session musicians.  The music is then recomposed and enhanced by LifeScore's Cellular Compositionâ„¢ algorithm and blended with relaxing, high-fidelity field recordings. The result is a soothing musical experience which will calm and focus the minds of younger listeners.  

Focus on Flow evokes a calm mindset and encourages creativity through peaceful orchestration.
