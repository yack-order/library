Title:: Starboy: Inspired by the Life and Lyrics of David Bowie
Author:: Jami Gigot
Description:: A starry-eyed ode to self-expression and staying true to yourself, inspired by the life and lyrics of beloved icon David Bowie.  For as long as David could remember, he felt like a stranger on his own planet. As if he’d fallen to Earth from outer space…  David Bowie is one of the most influential artists of our time, beloved for his joyful self-expression and fierce individuality. But how did he come to be this iconic Starman, celebrated by millions around the world?  

Inspired by the life and lyrics of David Bowie, author-illustrator Jami Gigot imagines the story of a lonely young boy enchanted by the music of the stars—yet no one else can hear the shimmy-shake rhythm that moves through his body. At first misunderstood and ignored, David ultimately finds the courage to be true to himself, sparking a dazzling revolution…  At once vibrantly imaginative and true to the spirit of Bowie, Starboy is about embracing your individuality and discovering the cosmic rhythm that hums within each of us.  

A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt and Company.
