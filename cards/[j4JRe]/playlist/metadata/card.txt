From the Creator:   “This is a recipe card that I made for my daughter. I wanted to make something that was easy enough for an 8-10 year old to make in the kitchen unassisted (still fun for younger children with assistance).  I also wanted to make something that could easily accommodate different diets. These yogurt cups are a family favorite. I hope you enjoy eating and making them as much as we do.”
