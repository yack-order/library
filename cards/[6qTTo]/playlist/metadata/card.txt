Title:: Narwhal: Unicorn of the Sea
Author:: Janet Halfmann
Description:: Narwhal is a happy-go-lucky narwhal. Jelly is a no-nonsense jellyfish. The two might not have a lot in common, but they do they love waffles, parties, and adventures. Join Narwhal and Jelly as they discover the whole wide ocean together. 

A wonderfully silly early graphic novel series, adapted for audio, featuring three stories. In the first, Jelly learns that Narwhal is a really good friend. Then Narwhal and Jelly form their own pod of awesomeness with their ocean friends. And finally, Narwhal and Jelly read the best book ever - even though it doesn't have any words...or pictures! 

Ben Clanton showcases the joys of friendship, the benefits of working together and the power of imagination in the delightful,  Eisner Award-winning Narwhal: Unicorn of the Sea.
