Description:: The Chicken Squad is back for their third (mis)adventure, and this time they're facing off with whatever's hiding in a mystery box in the backyard. Our fluffy, fearless young detectives are back out sleuthing because there's a new cage in the yard, and the Chicken Squad is determined to figure out just who this new addition is. Because whatever it is, it's definitely up to no good. So equipped with the latest surveillance gear--which apparently includes copious amounts of marshmallows--the chicks venture into the wild to get answers. Let's just hope they can beat that giant raincloud that's closing in.because everyone knows that chickens can't swim!
