Title:: Nap Time A-Z
Author:: Yoto & The LEGO Group
Description:: "Settle down little polar bear and close your eyes, it’s time to nap for a while. Get comfy, get cosy, get snuggly and warm, and wake up with a smile.” 

Aurora the polar bear cub needs a nap – but she’s much too curious to get to sleep. Alina and Sam to the rescue! They’re taking a ride in the Alphabet Truck to find an object from every letter of the alphabet to give Aurora the perfect nap time.

From a warm cup of cocoa to a soothing lullaby, can Alina and Sam find enough objects to get Aurora settled down and snoozing?
