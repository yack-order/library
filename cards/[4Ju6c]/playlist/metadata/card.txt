Title:: Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul 
Author:: Jeff Kinney
Description:: A family road trip is supposed to be a lot of fun . . . unless, of course, you're the Heffleys. The journey starts off full of promise, then quickly takes several wrong turns. Gas station bathrooms, crazed seagulls, a fender bender, and a runaway pig—not exactly Greg Heffley's idea of a good time. But even the worst road trip can turn into an adventure—and this is one the Heffleys won't soon forget.
