Title:: Toto the Ninja Cat and the Incredible Cheese Heist
Author:: Dermot O'Leary
Description:: "Toto is no ordinary cat, and she can't wait for you to join her on her second ninja adventure!

A funny animal escapade written and read by one of the UK's best loved broadcasters. For fans of The Aristocats, The Secret Life of Pets, 101 Dalmatians and Atticus Claw Breaks the Law.    

A hilarious story for all animal-loving kids, with gentle themes of friendship, inclusivity and winning in the face of adversity.  

Toto, the amazing ninja cat, is back and cooler than ever!   

Something cat-astrophic has happened: all the cheese in the world has been stolen. Join Toto, her brother Silver and their best-friend Catface on a secret mission to save the day. Toto is going to need all her ninja skills to defeat the fur-midable cheese thief.... 

Dermot says: 'The idea for Toto first came to me when my wife and I rescued two stray cats from an olive grove in Italy. One of them, Toto, has been blind from birth, but we quickly realised she had ninja-like reactions. Like a lot of cat owners (or cat servants), we like to imagine our pets having secret lives when we're out or asleep. So before I knew it I was writing about Toto and her brother Silver's nocturnal adventures around London. I really hope that children who pick it up enjoy reading the adventures of our little Italian underdog (cat).' "
