Title:: Little Badman and the Rise of the Punjabi Zombies (Digital)
Author:: Humza Arshad and Henry White
Description:: Brought to you by Puffin.
 
Welcome to Big School. Humza Khan - aka Little Badman, Eggington's greatest rapper - might have finally met his match. Evil teacher geniuses and giant killer hamsters are nothing compared to starting a new school.
 
 He's already been out rap-battled by the school bully, laughed at by his classmates. Oh, and we haven't even mentioned the ancient magical orb causing havoc and very possibly leading to world destruction.
 
 At least Humza has found someone to help with his homework. It's just a shame this friend isn't exactly . . . alive.
