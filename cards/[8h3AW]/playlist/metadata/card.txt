Title:: Runt
Author:: Craig Silvey
Description:: A heart-warming, funny, beautifully told story for readers of all ages from the bestselling author of Jasper Jones and Honeybee. 

'You don't have to carry the weight of the world in your tool belt.' Annie Shearer likes to fix things. She lives in the country town of Upson Downs with her best friend, an adopted stray dog called Runt. The two share a very special bond. After years evading capture, Runt is remarkably fast and agile, perfect for herding runaway sheep. But when greedy local landowner Earl Robert-Barren puts her family's home at risk, Annie directs Runt's extraordinary talents towards a different pursuit - winning the Agility Course Grand Championship at the lucrative Krumpets Dog Show in London. However, two things stand in her way. There is Fergus Fink, a vain and villainous dog handler determined to prevent Annie from upstaging him. And a curious predicament: Runt will only obey Annie's commands if nobody else is watching. Though she's used to fixing problems on her own, Annie enlists the help of her quirky family. There's Susie, her vibrantly fashionable mother, who is the worst baker in the nation. Her father, Bryan, who inherited the family farm and has a hidden passion for flower cultivation. Her teenage brother Max, an aspiring daredevil. And her grandmother Dolly, a one time champion sportswoman who, years after the death of her husband Wally, is now looking for love. Each make sacrifices and employ their own unique skills to get Annie and Runt to London. With all eyes on them, Annie and Runt must beat the odds and the fastest dogs in the world to save her farm. 

Runt is a heartwarming and hilarious tale of kindness, friendship, hurdles, hoops, tunnels, see-saws, and, above all, being yourself and bringing out the best in others.
