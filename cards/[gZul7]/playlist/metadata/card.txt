Title:: The Pout-Pout Fish, Far, Far from Home
Author:: Deborah Diesen
Description:: Mr. Fish has prepped and packed,
And he’s made big plans to roam.
He’s ready for adventure
On his trip away from home!

But sometimes trips have detours
And not everything goes right.
Without his favorite toy,
Can he fall asleep at night?

Mr. Fish has prepped and packed,
