Title:: Now Hear This!
Author:: The Juicebox Jukebox
Description:: “Now Hear This!” is a delightful new collection of playful handcrafted songs from The Juicebox Jukebox. Top to bottom the album weaves together a fresh and fun melodic tapestry of children’s education, positive character building themes, and a great sense of humour that will make anyone smile (parents and teachers included.) Inspiration comes from all directions and in many styles. There’s something here for everyone, truly giving it an unpredictably diverse jukebox listening experience!

Each song on “Now Hear This!” was written, recorded, produced and performed by singer/songwriter and father of three, Bradley James Skistimas. Additional dialogue and singing was provided by Bradley’s own children and nieces. The album was mixed and mastered by GRAMMY Award winning engineer Andy Zulla (Rod Stewart, Kelly Clarkson.)
