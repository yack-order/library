Title:: Henry and Beezus
Author:: Beverly Cleary
Description:: Well-meaning Henry Huggins would do anything to get the bike of his dreams. But every idea he has keeps falling flat. Selling bubble gum on the playground gets him in trouble with his teacher. There's the paper route, but Henry's dog Ribsy nearly ruins that with his nose for mischief. Even pesky little Ramona Quimby manages to get in the way of Henry's chance at a bike. But it's with the help of his best friend Beezus that there may be a way. After all--with a friend by your side, anything is possible.
