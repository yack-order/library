Title:: Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules
Author:: Jeff Kinney
Description:: Whatever you do, don't ask Greg about his summer vacation because he definitely doesn't want to talk about it.... It's a brand new year and a brand new journal and Greg is keen to put the humiliating (and secret!) events of last summer firmly behind him. But someone knows everything - someone whose job it is to most definitely not keep anything embarrassing of Greg's private - his big brother, Rodrick. How can Greg make it through this new school year with his not-quite-cool reputation intact?.
