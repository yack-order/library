Title:: The One and Only Shrek! Plus Five Other Stories
Author:: William Steig
Description:: Before Shrek made it on the silver screen, there was William Steig's SHREK!, a book about an ordinary ogre who leaves his swampy childhood home to go out and see the world. Ordinary, that is, if a foul and hideous being who ends up marrying the most stunningly ugly princess on the surface of the planet is what you consider ordinary. 

SHREK! can be found in this collection of six modern classics by Steig, along with stories concerning creatures ordinary and extraordinary, including Irene, a brave and loving little girl who must battle a howling blizzard, and Spinky, a boy who is so completely annoyed by his family that he no longer has any use for the human race.
