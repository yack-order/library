Title:: Dasher: How a Brave Little Doe Changed Christmas Forever
Author:: Matt Tavares
Description:: Dasher is an adventurous young reindeer with a wish in her heart. She spends her days with her family under the hot sun in a traveling circus, but she longs for a different life—one where there is snow beneath her hooves and the North Star above her head. One day, when the opportunity arises, Dasher seizes her destiny and takes off in pursuit of the life she wants to live. It’s not long before she meets a nice man in a red suit with a horse-drawn sleigh—a man named Santa. And soon, with the help of a powerful Christmas wish, nothing will be the same.
