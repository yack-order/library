Title:: Cyborg Cat and the Night Spider
Author:: Ade Adepitan
Description:: Ade loves playing football, and he's amazing in goal, despite the heavy metal caliper he has to wear on his leg. He can save any ball that's sent his way, from any direction, so his friends have nicknamed him the Cyborg Cat. But when the Parsons Road Gang stumble upon some unusual graffiti it starts to have a really weird effect on Ade. Somehow, the art is drawing him into another dimension, where he really is Cyborg Cat!   But that's not all - after seeing the Night Spider's art, Ade starts to feel weak, and everything begins to go wrong. He's banned from a school trip to a safari park because of his disability, and the doctors have some bad news about his legs.   

How can Ade overcome his challenges, and what power does the mysterious Night Spider have over Cyborg Cat? Ade needs all his friends' help to uncover the truth.
