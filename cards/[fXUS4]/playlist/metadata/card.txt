Description:: Spare The Rock Records presents Let All The Children Boogie: A Tribute To David Bowie, an all-ages album dedicated to the music and artistry of David Bowie. The album features new interpretations of his work from a diverse group of artists with the mission of sharing his legacy and messages with a new generation. 

David Bowie proved that there are no rules about who you should or could be in this world. His musical and artistic approach defined creative freedom. He lived a glowing life on his own terms, a shining example of the infinite possibilities out there. 

In addition to celebrating Bowie’s catalog and life’s work, the project introduces him to today’s kids. From “Kooks” to his narration of Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf to his role in Labyrinth and his own role as a father, it seemed Bowie always knew that children were a different species and he welcomed them into his world.
