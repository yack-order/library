Title:: My First Christmas Album
Author:: Various
Description:: Can you imagine Christmas without music? No singing, no jingling. Only Scrooge would be happy with that! It is a time for music to fill the air. Part of the fun is hearing things that are only played at Christmas and at no other time of year—carols that make you think of the end of term, or the holidays, or bobble hats; songs that make you think of food, or snow, or stockings. Here are some of the most popular carols, as well as some other surprises… Merry Christmas!
