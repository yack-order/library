Author:: Ladybird
Description:: Brought to you by Ladybird.    

A colourful collection of original stories celebrating Pride.     

Pride is all about embracing you for being you! These five stories will show children how to bring the teaching of “love is love” into their everyday lives, at home and in the playground.     

This collection acts as an introduction to the ideas behind the festival of Pride, helping young children understand the importance of this LGBTQIA+ event, and demonstrating how families can get involved in the celebrations.     

Join Ladybird for stories of community, diversity, acceptance, happiness, and of course, being proud!     

These stories are aimed at children aged four to seven for family listening, learning and the development of young minds.     

Other Ladybird Audio collections include Ladybird Magical Stories, Ladybird Audio Adventures, Ladybird Stories for Diwali and Ladybird Stories for Hanukkah.
