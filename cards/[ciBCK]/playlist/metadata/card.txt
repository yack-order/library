Title:: Wonderfully Wired Brains
Author:: Louise Gooding
Description:: Our brains are unique in the way they function, work, and think. Neurodiversity is still a relatively 'new' concept that can be tricky to understand, but this audiobook is here to help! This inspirational audiobook written and narrated by neurodiverse author Louise Gooding challenges misconceptions and shows how neurodivergent brains work a little differently.  

It is common for neurodiverse people and those with neurological differences to feel as though they don't fit in, but their extraordinary differences should be embraced. Wonderfully Wired Brains teaches children all about the awesome abilities that neurodiverse individuals have, introduces them to advocates who are challenging neurodiversity stereotypes, and most importantly gives them a safe space to feel accepted.  

This informative and educational audiobook for children features:  
- Accurate, understandable explanations of diagnoses that impact the brain, including each area of neurodiversity and what it can or does mean for anyone with that particular neurological difference. 
- A positive, friendly look at neurodiverse brains that debunks myths and stereotypes. 
- Informative, inclusive text  Combining neurodiverse experiences with science, history, and brain-bursting facts, Wonderfully Wired Brains has something for everyone!  

Whether your child is neurodiverse or not, this audiobook will inspire inquisitive young listeners and show them that no two brains function in the same way and that everyone's differences should be celebrated. There really is no other audiobook like it.
