Title:: Dungeons & Dragons: Dungeon Academy: Last Best Hope (Middle Grade Book #3) (Digital)
Author:: Madeline Roux
Description:: Zelli Stormclash and the Danger Club have only one goal: save their friend Bauble from the evil clutches of Elgred Morbide. There’s only one problem—the evil machinations of Morbide’s selfish plots have come to a head, and the final battle for Dungeon Academy has already begun. Deep beneath the desert, a monstrous dracolich is about to be unleashed, an evil, undead dragon bent on revenge against everything in her path.  Zelli is no longer on a rescue mission but a fated quest to save Dungeon Academy, Faerun, and all the Forgotten Realms. Our motley crew of heroes must rise to the occasion and wield the most important weapon an adventurer can carry: hope. Against impossible odds, the Danger Club—members old and new—must take one last stand together and fight like never before . . . till the very end.
