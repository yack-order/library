Title:: Bible Stories for the Young, Volume 2 of 5
Author:: 
Description:: The Beginning of a Kingdom - Kings and Chronicles

Summary: This is not a “children’s bible” or a “children’s translation.” This is good ol’ fashioned storytelling much like you’d do around a campfire or while tucking a child into bed. Our hope is to share with children the Alive and Active Word (Hebrews 4:12) that aims to get at the motives of why people (adults AND children!) do what they do.
