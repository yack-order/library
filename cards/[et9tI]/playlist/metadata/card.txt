Title:: Happy Narwhalidays
Author:: Ben Clanton
Description:: It’s the festive season in the world wide waters, and Narwhal is looking forward to cozying up with a good book, singing and partying with their pod pals and enjoying some warm waffle pudding. But most of all they’re excited about the arrival of the Merry Mermicorn! According to Narwhal, she's part mermaid, part unicorn and completely mer-aculous! Jelly is of course skeptical about the existence of the "Mira-Miny-What-A Corn" . . . even when Jelly receives a mysterious present. It must be from Narwhal. Now Jelly has to get the perfect gift, but finding a present for someone as unique as Narwhal is no easy feat, even when you have six tentacles. How will Jelly ever come up with a whaley great gift for a best pal who spreads cheer all through the year?
