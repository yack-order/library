Title:: Revolting Rhymes
Author:: Roald Dahl
Description:: This book is filled with revolting rhymes. 
(Be warned: It’s no ordinary Once Upon a Time). 

There’s poor Cindy whose heart was torn to shreds, 
because her Prince, he chops off heads! 

Snow White’s dwarfs although awfully nice, 
are guilty of one shocking vice… 

And what becomes of Goldilocks, that nasty thieving little louse, 
when she goes sneaking around the three bears' house… 

You'll love these intriguingly twisted versions of these much loved children's tales: Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Goldilocks, and the Three Little Pigs, served up with an ever-so-wicked Roald Dahl twist.
