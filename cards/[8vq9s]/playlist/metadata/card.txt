Title:: Armchair Adventures: A Join-In Story Podcast 
Author:: Made By Mortals
Description:: I'm on the lookout for some curious, brave and silly explorers to join me on an adventure!
Hey! I’m Connie Chief Adventurer here at Armchair Adventures Travel Agency - where we specialise in journeys of the imagination.

It's a super fun and a little bit bonkers, join-in story podcast for kids aged 6 to 10.

Join me and my gang of explorers for a new adventure in every episode. You’ll visit magical places, meet extraordinary people and learn a thing or two along the way.

It’s packed full of sing and move-along fun. It's perfect for playtime, those gloomy rainy days, boring car journeys, and with your gran!

New episodes are released twice a month, on the 1st and 3rd Thursdays.
