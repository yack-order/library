Title:: Toto the Ninja Cat and the Great Snake Escape
Author:: Dermot O'Leary
Description:: "Meet Toto: she's no ordinary cat, and she can't wait to have an adventure with you!

Join Toto for a funny animal escapade written by one of the UK's best-loved broadcasters. For fans of The Aristocats, The Secret Life of Pets, 101 Dalmatians and Atticus Claw Breaks the Law.

Toto the cat and her brother, Silver, live footloose and fancy-free in a townhouse in London. Toto is almost totally blind and learned to trust her senses from a ninja cat-master who taught her back in Italy, where they were born. By day Toto and Silver seem to be ordinary cats, but by night they love to have adventures!

One evening, news reaches Toto that a king cobra has escaped from London Zoo! Together with help from a very posh rat and two hungry tigers, Toto and Silver must investigate. Can they find the giant snake before it's too late?

Dermot says, 'The idea for Toto first came to me when my wife and I rescued two stray cats from an olive grove in Italy. One of them, Toto, has been blind from birth, but we quickly realised she had ninja-like reactions. Like a lot of cat owners (or cat servants), we like to imagine our pets having secret lives when we're out or asleep. So before I knew it, I was writing about Toto and her brother Silver's nocturnal adventures around London. I really hope that children who pick it up enjoy the adventures of our little Italian underdog (cat).'"
