Title:: Songs about School
Author:: Justin Roberts
Description:: Four-time GRAMMY Nominee Justin Roberts is one of the founders of the modern family music scene. For 25 years, Roberts has been creating the soundtrack to families’ lives, helping kids navigate the joys and sorrows of growing up, while inspiring parents to remember their own childhoods. His songs are the kind of get-stuck-in-your-head pop nuggets that draw comparisons to Elvis Costello and Paul Simon rather than simple nursery rhymes.

Justin has put this collection of songs together especially for Yoto. Inspired by school time moments we all love and remember, it’s the perfect soundtrack to get any little one excited about school.
