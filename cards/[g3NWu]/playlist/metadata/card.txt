Title:: A Ramadan to Remember
Author:: Marzieh A. Ali
Description:: Ramadan is almost here! It's Zain's favorite time of the year.  

Well, it usually is. After a recent move and with no mosque or Islamic school in his new neighborhood, will Zain find a new Muslim friend to celebrate with him?    

Children will learn what makes the ninth Islamic month special from pre-Ramadan decorating, the importance of fasting and volunteering in the community, and the festivities and prayers that continue through the month, ending with Eid al-Fitr.
