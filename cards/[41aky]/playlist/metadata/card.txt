Title:: Make Way for Ducklings/ Abran paso a los patitos
Author:: Robert McCloskey
Description:: Mrs. Mallard was sure that the pond in the Boston Public Gardens would be a perfect place for her and her eight ducklings to live. The problem was how to get them there through the busy streets of Boston. But with a little help from the Boston police, Mrs. Mallard and Jack, Kack, Lack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack arrive safely at their new home.  

This brilliant, amusingly observed tale of mallards on the move has won the hearts of generations. Awarded the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished American picture book for children in 1941, it has since become a favorite of millions.
