Title:: You Are a Champion: How to Be the Best You Can Be
Author:: Marcus Rashford, Carl Anka
Description:: "I want to show you how you can be a champion in almost anything you put your mind to."

Marcus Rashford MBE is famous worldwide for his skills both on and off the pitch – but before he was a Manchester United and England footballer, and long before he started his inspiring campaign to end child food poverty, he was just an ordinary kid from Wythenshawe, South Manchester. Now the nation's favourite footballer wants to show YOU how to achieve your dreams, in this positive and inspiring guide for life.  

Written with journalist Carl Anka, You Are a Champion is packed full of stories from Marcus’s own life, brilliant advice and top-tips from performance psychologist Katie Warriner. It will show you how to be the very BEST that you can be.  It shows kids how to: 
- Be comfortable with who you are – you can't be a champion until you're happy being you! 
- Dream big - Practise like a champion 
- Get out of your comfort zone and learn from your mistakes 
- Navigate adversity in a positive way 
- Find your team 
- Use your voice and stand up for others 
- Never stop learning  

With an afterword by Tim S. Grover.
