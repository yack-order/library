Title:: Magical Stories
Author:: Moshi
Description:: Heartwarming and magical, this Moshi Story tells of Cali the Mermaid princessâ€™s forbidden romance with a lovestruck Moshling called Linton, deep beneath the moonlit waves of Potion Ocean.

Kids can drift to sleep as they soar into the Moshi skies, over breathtaking sights, on a magic carpet piloted by Blue Jeepers, a cute little Moshling tiger cub who loves to travel. This epic moonlit journey is as enchanting as it is sleepy, for grown-ups as well as little ones.
