Title:: ABC Move With Me-By Momma Bear Audio
Author:: 
Description:: Hey friends! It’s Ms.Rylee here and it is time to move our bodies! I assigned an exercise to each letter of the alphabet. We will go through and spell different words together and do the exercise for each of those letters. You’ll have a set amount of time for each exercise, so do as many of each exercise as you can until the music stops! At the end of the playlist, you can spell your own words by scrolling through to each different letter! Let's get movin' and groovin'!
