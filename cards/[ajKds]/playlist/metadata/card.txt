Title:: White Noise
Author:: Yoto
Description:: The perfect noise for blocking out household sounds and noisy siblings. 

White Noise uses the whole frequency spectrum to block out other sounds and distractions, encouraging a good night’s sleep. 

Although the term White Noise is used to refer to all ambient noise, the real deal is actually very distinctive and evokes radio static or hissing steam. It’s perfect for light sleepers, children with noisy siblings, or those with an active nightlife outside their bedroom window!
