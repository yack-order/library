This audiobook was specifically written by Early Years expert and children's media creator, Laura Henry-Allain MBE, to support parents, teachers and guardians to explain what racism is, why it is wrong, and what children can do if they see it or experience it. It also explores how important it is for children to celebrate their achievements and greatness.   

My Skin, Your Skin is aimed at children aged four and above. Containing explanations on key words and concepts explained in child-friendly, accessible language, with relatable examples, to support children's understanding in building an anti-racist stance from an early age.   It is perfect to listen at home, and in classrooms, to support your child's life-long learning journey.
