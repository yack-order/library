Title:: Mars! Earthlings Welcome: Our Universe, Book 5
Author:: Stacy McAnulty
Description:: From writer Stacy McAnulty comes Mars! Earthlings Welcome is a light-hearted nonfiction audiobook about the red planet—told from the perspective of Mars himself...

Meet Mars! The red planet. Planet Marvelous. Favorite sibling of Earth (or so he claims). Sometimes they're close (just 34.5 million miles apart). Sometimes they need space (250 million miles apart)! Earth and Mars have a lot in common—clouds, mountains, polar icecaps. And while Earth has Earthlings, Mars makes a persuasive case for why people should make the journey to spend time with him. His day is 7 minutes longer! He is home to the largest volcano in the whole solar system. He's, well, marvelous.

With characteristic humor and charm, Stacy McAnulty channels the voice of Mars in this next celestial "autobiography" in the Our Universe series. Rich with kid-friendly facts, this is an equally charming and irresistible audiobook.
