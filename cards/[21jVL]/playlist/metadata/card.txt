Description:: Sing along with Miss Katie and join her on an imaginative camping adventure!

Singalong Story: Camping Trip! is an exciting adventure of guided imaginative play, songs, and sound effects about camping in the forest. We set up a tent, go for a nature walk, see some creatures, make s'mores, and watch the stars at night!
