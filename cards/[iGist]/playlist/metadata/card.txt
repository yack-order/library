Author:: Culture Kids Productions
Description:: Culture Kids is a multiple award-winning podcast and nonprofit organization on a mission to make a multicultural mindset the default for the next generation. We take young listeners on exciting adventures to countries, cities, and cultures all around the world—exploring topics such as holidays, cuisine, traditions, and even animals around the world.

We don’t just teach children about differences—we embrace them with curiosity, understanding, and friendship. Along the way, we uncover surprising similarities that connect us all, building bridges across communities and cultures. We proudly partner with cultural organizations, educators, and authors from all corners of the world to bring authentic voices and rich stories to life. As our 6-year-old listener shared, our show "creates love around the world."

So pack your imaginary passports and grab your bags because it’s time to become globe-trotting explorers right where you are!
