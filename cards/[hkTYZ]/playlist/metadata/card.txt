Title:: Charlie Morphs Into a Mammoth
Author:: Sam Copeland
Description:: Brought to you by Puffin.   

Charlie McGuffin is closer than ever to being able to control his crazy ability to turn into animals, but there are some things he can't control, like the arguments his parents keep having (which are making him more worried than ever) or the spate of mysterious animal disappearances spreading through town (which seem somehow to be connected to Charlie himself) or the fact that he doesn't have a date for the school dance (which is coming up fast). With the support of best friends Flora, Mohsen and Wogan, can Charlie unravel the mystery of the pet-nappings in time to shake a tail-feather at the disco? Or will his hidden adversary reveal Charlie's biggest secret to the world...?
