Title:: Brown Noise
Author:: Yoto
Description:: A rumbling ambient noise that evokes distant waterfalls and heavy rain. 

Brown Noise evokes a distant waterfall, an approaching storm and rumbling waves, and will make it easy for your little ones to relax and drift off. 

It feels softer and deeper than White and Pink Noise because it has fewer high frequencies, so itâ€™s perfect for sleepers with sensitive ears.
