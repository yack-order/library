Title:: Revvin' Up the Reindeer
Author:: Brady Rymer and the Little Band that Could
Description:: "Good will is in the air - along with a healthy dose of crazy.  Sugar and spice and family traditions abound.  And then there’s all that magical music.  It’s like the whole world is singin’!

When the song “Revvin’ Up the Reindeer” first came to Brady Rymer, he felt like a kid on Christmas morning.  And a new tune or two has been waiting under the tree every year since.  So, after miles of twinkly lights untangled, menorahs lit with love and more than a few eggnogs poured, the first collection of all-original holiday songs, Revvin’ Up the Reindeer was brought to life.

IT'S TIME TO ROCK YOUR HOLIDAY JAM!"
