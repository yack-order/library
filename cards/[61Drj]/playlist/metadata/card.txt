Title:: Room on the Broom
Author:: Julia Donaldson
Description:: The witch and her cat fly happily over forests, rivers and mountains on their broomstick until a stormy wind blows away the witch's hat, bow and wand. Luckily, they are retrieved by a dog, a bird and a frog, who are all keen for a ride on the broom. It's a case of the more, the merrier, but the broomstick isn't used to such a heavy load and it's not long beforeâ€¦ snap! It breaks in two! And with a greedy dragon looking for a snack, the witch's animal pals better think fast.
