Title:: Songs about Animals
Author:: Justin Roberts
Description:: Four-time GRAMMY Nominee Justin Roberts is one of the founders of the modern family music scene. For 25 years, Roberts has been creating the soundtrack to familiesâ€™ lives, helping kids navigate the joys and sorrows of growing up, while inspiring parents to remember their own childhoods. His songs are the kind of get-stuck-in-your-head pop nuggets that draw comparisons to Elvis Costello and Paul Simon rather than simple nursery rhymes.

Everyone loves music, even animals. These songs celebrate all our friends from the animal world, perfect for dancing along too with pets!
