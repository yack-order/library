Title:: Laurie Berkner's Animal Songs
Author:: The Laurie Berkner Band
Description:: Rock along with award-winning children’s music artist Laurie Berkner and her band. In this album, you’ll meet a mouse in a toolbox, go swimming with a goldfish, dance with dinosaurs and buzz like a bumblebee!

Laurie says: “I find animals incredibly fun to sing about. Perhaps it’s because I love making animal noises! Here is a collection of songs about all different kinds of animals – from bugs to baby rhinos, and dragons to dogs to dinosaurs. Have fun acting them out together!”

Laurie Berkner has sold over 1.1 million albums since her start in 1992. With 10 award-winning albums, critics widely acknowledge Laurie’s major contribution to launching what is now dubbed the progressive “kindie rock” movement.
