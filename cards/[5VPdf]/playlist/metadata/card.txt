Title:: A Bad Kitty Christmas
Author:: Nick Bruel
Description:: "Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the city, not a creature was stirring... Except for BAD KITTY."

A greedy Bad Kitty didn't get all the presents she wanted for Christmas, but after she goes on a Christmas caper across town and through multiple alphabets, she makes a new friend, finds an old friend, and learns the true meaning of Christmas. Or not. Nick Bruel's newest Bad Kitty audiobook is full of rhyming mayhem... and Christmas cheer.
