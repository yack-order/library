Title:: Collar Cases #1: Case of the Robbed Recipe
Author:: Amanda Trumpower
Description:: As a dog devoted to snacks, Alex Digger adores Grandma Basset’s famous treats. So when a terrible theft threatens the future of her business, Alex vows to find the thief before the loss forces Grandma to close up shop forever. Was it a disgruntled ex-employee? The suspiciously evasive Chief Flavor Engineer? Or perhaps an unknown sinister force lurking beneath the small town peace? 

Alex Digger and his best friend, Mittens Meow, are the most famous investigative reporters at the Bowwow Bark, but they’ll need all their wits to crack this case. Otherwise, Alex might starve!  

This is the first book in the Collar Cases mysteries, a funny Christian chapter book series for kids ages 7-12.
