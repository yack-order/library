Author:: Roald Dahl
Description:: Brought to you by Penguin.  Presenting a mischievous new reading of Roald Dahl's George's Marvellous Medicine, read by BAFTA-winning comedian Romesh Ranganathan. This immersive audiobook is bursting with phizzwhizzing sound effects, dynamic sound design, and original music composed by Rusty Bradshaw.   George Kranky's grandma is a grouch. She's always mean to George (and not much nicer to his parents either). She just LOVES being mean and miserable!    Once when George is put in charge of giving Grandma her medicine, he wonders if he could come up with his own remedy to try and help her become less of a grump.    So, using some rather unusual ingredients, George creates his magic medicine*. But will it stop his grandma from being so horrible . . . or will it blow the top of her head off?!  *WARNING: Do NOT try to make George's Marvellous Medicine yourselves at home. It's likely to be dangerous.   Listen to George's Marvellous Medicine and other fantastical Roald Dahl audiobooks, including:  James and the Giant Peach, read by James Acaster. Matilda, read by Kate Winslet. The BFG, read by David Walliams. The Twits, read by Richard Ayoade. The Witches, read by Lolly Adefope.
