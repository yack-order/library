Title:: Lil' Muffin Drops the Mic
Author:: Romesh Ranganathan
Description:: From comedy SUPERSTAR Romesh Ranganathan comes a hilarious and heartfelt tale that proves rap battles and baking muffins really can mix.
 
 Ever since James's dad left, he can't seem to stop worrying about everything. Luckily his favourite hobby baking is a fun (and delicious!) distraction. But no matter how many amazing cheese scones James makes, he still feels like there's a missing ingredient in his life.
 
 When James hears someone rapping in the playground one breaktime, he's completely hooked and starts writing his own raps featuring all of his favourite things - maths, his giant pet rabbit Graham and of course - cake!
 
 Then he discovers that grime artist Brukka is on the hunt for new talent and James wonders if this is his chance to share his muffins, his music, and maybe even his feelings with the whole school. If he can just find the confidence . . .
