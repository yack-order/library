Title:: It’s Time for Bed (Digital)
Author:: Ceporah Mearns and Jeremy Debicki
Description:: It’s time for Siasi to go to bed, but she doesn’t want to brush her teeth or put away her toys. It’s so much more fun to play with all the animals of the Arctic! Wouldn’t everyone rather dance with polar bear, howl with the wolves, and swim with the fish instead of get ready for bed? In this charming bedtime story, readers follow Siasi on a nighttime adventure as she comes up with excuse after excuse for why she’s not quite ready to go to bed.

This digital card includes both an English and an Inuktitut language version of the story.
