""Human beans is not really believing in giants, is they? Human beans is not thinking we exist.""    

One dark, silvery moonlit night, Sophie is snatched from her bed by a giant! Luckily it is the Big Friendly Giant (the BFG), who is no ordinary bone-crunching giant, but instead prefers snozzcumbers and frobscottle to children. But there are other giants in Giant Country. And those giants have a plan to gallop far and wide to find some tasty human beans to eat. Can Sophie and the BFG stop them?    

The text in this edition of The BFG was updated in 2022 for young independent readers.
