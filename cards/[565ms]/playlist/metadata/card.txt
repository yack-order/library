Title:: Play All Day!
Author:: London Rhymes
Description:: 'Play all day' is all about songs that might help get you all through the day â€“ from dawn till dusk! Written together with parents and tots on our projects around London, they are written in response to the realities of modern-day parenting, the highs and the lows. We've turned nappy changes, hand washing, bathtime, potty training and more into theme tunes to your day!
