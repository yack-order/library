Title:: Lila Greer, Teacher of the Year
Author:: Andrea Beaty
Description:: Lila Greer is full of worries. Even the smallest things—from cabbages to cardboard—fill her with dread and What Ifs. So when her family makes a big change—moving to a new town—the worry and What Ifs only grow. What if things go wrong? What if no one likes her?  At first, Lila feels right to be worried. In her new home, everything is strange. The new kids, the new smells. Lila feels alone and invisible. But there’s one person who sees her: Lila’s teacher, Ms. Kern. Through some creativity, blackboard erasers, and—most of all—kindness, Ms. Kern finds a way to make Lila feel welcome and open to new experiences, a lesson that will resonate with Lila long after second grade.
