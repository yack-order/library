Title:: Jolley-Rogers and the Pirate Piper
Author:: Jonny Duddle
Description:: One morning the townspeople of Dull-on-Sea wake to find that their town is overrun with rats. Big rats, small rats, fierce rats, hungry rats – it is an infestation! Just when everyone is at their wit's end, a nautical stranger who plays the pipe turns up and offers to get rid of the rodent problem – for a fee. 

Once the rats have gone, the greedy mayor refuses to pay – so the Pirate Piper plays an enchanted tune and leads the children away. It's up to Matilda, Jim and Nugget to save their friends.

The fourth title in Jonny Duddle's bestselling Jolley-Rogers fiction series.
