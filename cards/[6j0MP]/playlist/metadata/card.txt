Title:: Dungeons & Dragons: Dungeon Academy: Tourney of Terror (Middle Grade Novel #2) (Digital)
Author:: Madeline Roux
Description:: Something BIG has come knocking on the gates of Dungeon Academy! The undefeated Waterdeep Dragons have arrived for the Tourney of Terror games, which occur every half century. The Academy Flumphs are outnumbered, outsized, and outmonstered. But our hero, Zelli Stormclash-a forbidden human, secretly disguised as a minotaur-is no stranger to impossible odds, and neither are her friends, the Danger Club, who recently battled a necromancer and his army of undead!  

If the Waterdeep Dragons weren't enough to raise scales, Zelli's recurring nightmare of a dark entity annihilating her world may be more than just a bad dream. Something sinister lurks in the halls of the school, and only Zelli seems to notice. But when Zelli uncovers a dark past hidden deep beneath Dungeon Academy, she unlocks something that will endanger her school, the tournament, and everything within the Forgotten Realms.
