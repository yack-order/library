Title:: MYO Guide 4
Author:: 
Description:: In steps 1 and 2 we went through the basics of linking audio from the Yoto App to a Make Your Own card. And we deleted step 3! Now we are going to take things up a notch and learn about recording audio in the Yoto App. 

You can record yourself reading a bedtime story, or telling a joke, or maybe even recording a message to a loved one. And in the next activity in this series, we will learn how to turn your recordings into a playlist that you can put onto a Make Your Own card.

To complete this activity, you will need to link this guide to a Make Your Own card first, then listen to it in a player. (This is so you can use the Yoto App to record some audio at the same time.)
