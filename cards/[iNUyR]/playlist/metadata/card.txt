Title:: Aaron Slater, Illustrator
Author:: Andrea Beaty
Description:: Aaron Slater loves listening to stories and dreams of one day writing them himself. But when it comes to reading, the letters just look like squiggles to him, and it soon becomes clear he struggles more than his peers. When his teacher asks each child in the class to write a story, Aaron canâ€™t get a single word down. He is sure his dream of being a storyteller is out of reach... until inspiration strikes, and Aaron finds a way to spin a tale in a way that is uniquely his.
