Title:: Ramona and Her Mother
Author:: Beverly Cleary
Description:: Ramona Quimby is no longer seven, but not quite eight. She's seven and a half right now, if you ask her. Not allowed to stay home alone, yet old enough to watch pesky Willa Jean, Ramona wonders when her mother will treat her like her older, more mature sister, Beezus.

But with her parents' unsettling quarrels and some spelling trouble at school, Ramona wonders if growing up is all it's cracked up to be. No matter what, she'll always be her mother's little girl...right?
