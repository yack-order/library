Title:: Edie and the Box of Flits (Digital)
Author:: Kate WIlkinson
Description:: A modern classic set against the backdrop of the London Underground, this is a timeless story of friendship, family and noticing the little things in life.  

When eleven-year-old Edie Winter finds a mysterious box on the London Underground, she goes straight to take it to her father, an employee of the London Underground Lost Property Office. But on her way, Edie is amazed to discover that the box is home to a family of Flits - tiny winged people. 

And these Flits - Impy, Speckle and Nid - need Edie's help. Not only do they need supplies (rice crispies, sugar sprinkles, digestive biscuits and raisins) and someone to look after them, but their brother Jot has run away and they need Edie's help to find him."
