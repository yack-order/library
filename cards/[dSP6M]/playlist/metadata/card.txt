Title:: Ticket to Brazil 2: Samba!
Author:: Various
Description:: Yoto says: From the streets of Rio to the heart of Bahia, let the sounds of the tamborim and the agogô transport you to the carnival!

For our second ticket to Brazil Yoto card, we present a celebration of samba music. Featuring the likes of Ze Roberto with his homage to Brazilian Gran Prix driver Emerson Fittipaldi, where the pounding rhythms transport you behind the wheel of a racing car driving at top speed. Elsewhere you'll find Trio Mocotó's sumptuous dose of orchestral samba, Os Panteras' lambada groover, and Lemos and Debéito's samba rock style. The card is packed with Brazilian heat that will get the whole family dancing around the room to the sensational samba sound.
