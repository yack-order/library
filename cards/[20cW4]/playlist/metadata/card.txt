Title:: Wild Wet World (Digital)
Author:: Cosmo Sheldrake
Description:: Wild Wet World is an homage to the ocean, pieced together by the brilliant Cosmo Sheldrake slowly over a period of ten years! 

It features the sounds of humpback whales singing, sperm whales clicking, Weddell seals courting, coral reefs spluttering, bucktoothed parrot fish crunching, an oyster toadfish grunting, pistol shrimp snapping, long horned sculpins honking, blue whales lamenting, and haddock drumming, and a rare recording of the voices of the the U.K's last remaining killer whale population who, along with their unique dialect are doomed to extinction as they are no longer fertile due to chemical contaminants in their waters.

Tracks include:
1) Bathed In Sound
2) Bodies of Water
3) Murky Reef (Benthos)
4) Plankton
5) Whale Song Movement (Blow Hole)
6) Whale Song Movement 2 (Pelagy)
7) Nekton
8) Nekton (with Orcas)
9) West Coast Community Sound Bed for Nekton
