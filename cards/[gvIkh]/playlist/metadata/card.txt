Title:: The Princess and the Warrior/ La Princesa y el Guerrero
Author:: Duncan Tonatiuh
Description:: Izta was the most beautiful princess in the land, and suitors traveled from far and wide to woo her. She fell in love with Popoca, a brave warrior who fought in her father’s army—and a man who did not offer her riches but a promise to stay by her side forever. The emperor did not want his daughter to marry a mere warrior, but he offered Popoca a deal: If the warrior could defeat their enemy, Jaguar Claw, then the emperor would permit Popoca and Izta to wed. But Jaguar Claw had a plan to thwart the warrior. Would all be lost?
