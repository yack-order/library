Title:: Just So Stories by Rudyard Kipling (unabridged)
Author:: 
Description:: Fictional, humorous tales on how things came about. Kipling told these stories to his children & made the original images from his woodcut designs. Kipling explained: "In the evening there were stories meant to put Effie [his daughter, "Best Beloved"] to sleep, and you were not allowed to alter those by one single little word. They had to be told just so; or Effie would wake up and put back the missing sentence. So at last they came to be like charms, all three of them [whale, camel & rhino]."
