Author:: LifeScore Music
Description:: LifeScore Cards are immersive soundscapes that encourage a calm state of mind. Each card contains an hour-long piece of music (playing in loop)  composed by world-class composers and played by legendary session musicians.  The music is then recomposed and enhanced by LifeScore's Cellular Compositionâ„¢ algorithm and blended with relaxing, high-fidelity field recordings. The result is a soothing musical experience which will help younger listeners to concentrate and think clearly.  

Focus on Thinking evokes a clear mindset and encourages focus through peaceful orchestration.
