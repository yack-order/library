Title:: Laurie Berkner's Transportation Songs
Author:: The Laurie Berkner Band
Description:: Rock along with award-winning children’s music artist Laurie Berkner and her band. In this album, you’ll blast off in a rocket ship, cruise in a car, chug along in a train and soar through the skies in a plane!

Laurie says: “What is more evocative than vehicles that move and take us places? This collection includes songs about the traditional trucks, cars, planes and boats, but also covers flying boxes, rocketships, and animal travel!"

Laurie Berkner has sold over 1.1 million albums since her start in 1992. With 10 award-winning albums, critics widely acknowledge Laurie’s major contribution to launching what is now dubbed the progressive “kindie rock” movement.
