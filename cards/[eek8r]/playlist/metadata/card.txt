From the Creator: “Join Herbert in his New York adventure while he flutters around the city searching for fragrant herbs to build his nest. But how will Alma have her pasta pesto now that all the basil has disappeared? And how will Yussef make his Baba's mint tea without any fresh mint? Travel from Manhattan to Brooklyn and from the Bronx to Queens, meeting new friends and sharing their favourite recipes!”
