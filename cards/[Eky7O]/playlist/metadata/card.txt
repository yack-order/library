From NBA All-Star Chris Paul comes an inspirational and uplifting audiobook about chasing your basketball dreams and the lessons he learned both on and off the court from his beloved grandfather Papa Chilly.  

Growing up, young Chris Paul dreamed of playing professional basketball. But he knew it would take more than dedication and practice, so Chris looked to his grandfather Papa Chilly as a shining example of the values he could apply both in basketball and in life. Papa taught him about respect, faith, kindness, generosity, and the determination to succeed, just as Papa had succeeded as the first Black business owner of a service station in North Carolina. Serving as a beacon of inspiration for Chris, Papa Chilly and his lessons propelled Chris to become the star NBA player—and person—he is today.
