Title:: The Ugly Five
Author:: Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler
Description:: Who needs cute critters? It’s time to celebrate ugly animals! The Ugly Five are proud of how hideous they are. There’s the bristly wildebeest, the yucky bald vulture, the spotty hyena and the gangly marabou stork. Not to mention the warthog, who is covered in – you guessed it – warts! As they swagger across the African savannah, showing off their glorious yuckiness, their cheeky rhymes will make you laugh out loud. Don’t be disgusted. They might be gangly, warty, bumpy, bristly, spotty and stinky – but they’re perfect just the way they are!
