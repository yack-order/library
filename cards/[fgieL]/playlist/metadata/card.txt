Title:: The King of Nowhere
Author:: Rockford's Rock Opera
Description:: Far away in the Sea of Tranquility is the Island of Infinity, home to the last one of every extinct animal species. This is where the sticky Cocklebur Ick must now find a home. But her search brings her into the domain of the mysterious King of Nowhere, the most feared creature on Infinity. 

The King of Nowhere, the second adventure from Rockford's Rock Opera, is a tale about extinction and redemption. It's a hopeful story that shows that even the smallest creatures can make the biggest difference and that although we may sometimes may feel lost, there is always hope. 

A psychedelic, spell-binding, thought-provoking 21st century adventure!
