Title:: Camping in Rural France
Author:: Yoto
Description:: A mix of natural and human sounds brings this campsite atmosphere to life. 

The wind through the trees and a chorus of crickets create a Pink Noise ambience in this campfire soundscape. 

Your little ones will enjoy the familiar yet distant sounds of dogs, friendly conversation and the rustling of backpacks as campers prepare for a hard-earned sleep. Salut!
