Title:: Bearily Bear Reimagined Fairy Tales
Author:: Bearily Bear Stories
Description:: Bearily Bear Fairy Tale retellings feature problem-solving, smart and empowered princesses that are capable of saving themselves.     

Children will love the culturally diverse fairy tales like Brown Rapunzel, A Story of a Smart Princess and a Certain Pea, Sleeping Beauty from Morocco, Snow White from Sudan and more!     

The series also pays particular attention to making these stories more inclusive, highlighting stories from around the world (or setting familiar stories in different geographic locations) and different family dynamics with recurring themes of compassion and empathy. Bearily Bear was selected by Common Sense Media and by Romper as a Best Story Podcast.
