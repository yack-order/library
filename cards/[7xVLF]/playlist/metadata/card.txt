When Carmela wakes up on her birthday, her wish has already come true - she's finally old enough to join her big brother as he does the family errands. Together, they travel through their neighborhood, past the crowded bus stop, the fenced-off repair shop, and the panadería, until they arrive at the laundromat, where Carmela finds a lone dandelion growing in the pavement. But before she can blow its white fluff away, her brother tells her she has to make a wish. If only she can think of just the right wish to make.... With lyrical, stirring text and evocative narration, Matt de la Peña and has delivered a moving ode to family, to dreamers, and to finding hope in the most unexpected places.
