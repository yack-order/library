Author:: Stacy McAnulty
Description:: Our Planet! There's No Place Like Earth is a nonfiction audiobook about the Earth, told from the perspective of Earth herself.

Meet Earth. Planet Awesome! And your awesome home! Actually, Earth is home to all the plants and all the animals in the solar system, including nearly eight billion people. Humans have accidentally moved Earth's climate change into the fast lane, and she needs your help to put on the brakes. Earthlings need Earth, and Earth needs Earthlings, so letâ€™s save Earth together!

With characteristic humor and charm, Stacy McAnulty channels the voice of Earth in this next celestial "autobiography" in the Our Universe series. Rich with kid-friendly facts, this is an equally charming and irresistible audiobook.
