Title:: Oliver Twist: Retold for Younger Listeners
Author:: Charles Dickens / Roy McMillan
Description:: Oliver Twist runs away from the brutality of the workhouse only to find himself taken in by a gang of thieves run by the devilish Fagin, his violent side-kick Bill Sikes and the irrepressible Artful Dodger. Rescued from London’s dingiest and darkest dens but then forced to help in a violent burglary, Oliver’s chances of survival are slim, and his chances of happiness almost nil. But one member of the gang risks everything to save him – and loses everything as a result. Roy McMillan combines an abridged version of Dickens’s novel with his own helpful explanations to retell the story for younger listeners.
