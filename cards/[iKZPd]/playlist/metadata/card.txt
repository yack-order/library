Title:: Toto the Ninja Cat and the Mystery Jewel Thief
Author:: Dermot O'Leary
Description:: "Toto is no ordinary cat, and she can't wait for you to join her on her fourth ninja adventure! From one of the UK's best-loved broadcasters, purrfect for fans of The Aristocats, The Secret Life of Pets and Atticus Claw Breaks the Law. 

Toto and her friends are due to be looking after the French ambassador on a day of sightseeing, finishing at the Tower of London to see the animal world's crown jewels: a sacred diamond cat collar. 

But when they arrive, the collar has disappeared - and what's worse, it looks like Toto is responsible! Toto is almost arrested, but she escapes to try and get to the bottom of the mystery and clear her name. 

She and her friends will have to follow some strange clues that will take them to a secret bookshop, Buckingham Palace and the rats' underground city in the sewers...can they defeat an unexpected villain and bring the thief to justice?

With gentle themes of friendship, inclusivity and winning in the face of adversity, this is a hilarious must-listen for all animal-loving kids! 

Dermot says: 'The idea for Toto first came to me when my wife and I rescued two stray cats from an olive grove in Italy. One of them, Toto, has been blind from birth, but we quickly realised she had ninja-like reactions. Like a lot of cat owners (or cat servants), we like to imagine our pets having secret lives when we're out or asleep. So before I knew it I was writing about Toto and her brother Silver's nocturnal adventures around London. I really hope that children who pick it up enjoy reading the adventures of our little Italian underdog (cat).'"
