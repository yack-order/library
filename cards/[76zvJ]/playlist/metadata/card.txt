Description:: Four dramatised stories starring everyone's favourite bear, introduced by Michael Hordern, who narrated the original BBC TV series Paddington. Included here are 'Please Look After This Bear', 'A Bear in Hot Water', 'A Disappearing Trick Paddington', and 'The Amateur Dramatics'.

'Please look after this bear', said the label around Paddington's neck, so the Brown family take him home and do just that. Life with Paddington, however, is full of surprises - as you'll find out in these four great dramatised stories!
