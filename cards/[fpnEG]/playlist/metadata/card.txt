Title:: Dark Shadows: Yes, Another Misadventure
Author:: Doreen Cronin
Description:: The Chicken Squad is back for their fourth (mis)adventure, and this time they're facing their darkest mystery yet: shadows! A hilarious, "easy to read" (Booklist) chapter book from the bestselling author of Click, Clack, Moo and The Trouble with Chickens. There's a big, SHADOWY, mystery lurking about on what was supposed to be a nice chicken-family vacation to a farm. Sugar is certain that she is being watched, and when Poppy's beloved shoe (the shoe that keeps her safe and snug) goes missing, Sugar is sure that this shadow is the culprit. But how does the Chicken Squad tackle a shadow? And do it without ruining the family reunion.which includes meeting eighty-five cousins whose names all begin with the letter B, a lesson on figuring out perimeters (no, Sugar, the perimeter of a car is not one mile), and deciding how many bags of jellybeans one should pack for a road trip?
