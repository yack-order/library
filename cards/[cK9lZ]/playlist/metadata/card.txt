Title:: Culture Kids Podcast
Author:: Kristen & Asher
Description:: Culture Kids is a family podcast dedicated to empowering a generation of kind and empathetic innovators, creators and global citizens of the world. We focus on opening the hearts and minds of children through culture, geography and travel related topics. Through each episode, we want to help create a more kind and tolerant world for children everywhere and help them see the beauty in our differences. But at the same time, as the great Maya Angelous said, "We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike." In almost every episode, we emphasize the idea that all families are different, and that it is always okay to be different.
