Title:: Devon Hedgerow
Author:: Yoto
Description:: A gentle ocean breeze meets the joyful singing of beach-going birds. 

This lighthearted litany hails from the UK’s Jurassic Coast, named for its many dinosaur fossils. 

But these are no pterodactyls - instead, sparrows, robins and wrens lend their merry melodies to the whispering waves of Devon’s beaches.
