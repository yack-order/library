Title:: Mr Gum and the Biscuit Billionaire
Author:: Andy Stanton
Description:: Mr Gum is back and as nasty as ever in this second hilarious story, read by the author and with music and sound effects. A fantastic book for boys and girls aged 7-10 years old.

Good evening. OK, this book’s a bit hard to describe. There’s this gingerbread man with electric muscles, see? And he’s rich as a mushroom, right? And Mr Gum and Billy William are planning to get the cash, yeah? And it’s up to Polly to save the day.

And there’s a funfair and hot dogs, and Friday O’Leary shouts out some crazy stuff, and... hey, that wasn’t so hard to describe after all! See ya!
