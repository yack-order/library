Title:: The Boy Who Lived with Dragons
Author:: Andy Shepherd
Description:: Tomas has a secret – a big secret. He has his own tiny dragon, Flicker! A dragon which grew on a very special tree at the bottom of his granddad's garden. And not only that – his friends Ted, Kai and Kat have dragons, too, all grown on the same dragonfruit tree…

Having your own dragon is magical – but Tomas is also about to find out what living with a dragon is really like. When the fire breathing kicks in and you get singed every five seconds, it's like having an unpredictable volcano in your pocket. Learning to train the dragons and keep them out of trouble at school and home will take all Tomas' creativity and patience…
