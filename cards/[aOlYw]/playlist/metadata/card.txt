Title:: The Capture (Guardians of Ga'Hoole, Book 1)
Author:: Kathryn Lasky
Description:: Soren is born in the forest of Tyto, a tranquil kingdom where the Barn Owls dwell. But evil lurks in the owl world, evil that threatens to change Soren’s life forever.  Soren is captured and taken to a dark and forbidding canyon where there is a mysterious school. It’s called an orphanage, but Soren believes it’s something far worse.  He and his new friend, the clever and scrappy Gylfie, find out that the orphanage is actually a training camp. Soren and Gylfie know that the only way out is up. To escape, they will need to do something these fledglings have never done before—fly. And so begins a magical journey. Along the way, Soren and Gylfie meet Twilight and Digger. The four owls band together to seek the truth, be reunited with their families, and protect the owl world from unimaginable danger.
