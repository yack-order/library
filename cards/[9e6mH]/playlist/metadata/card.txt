Title:: Roll 2 Six sided dice! (Beta 1.0)
Author:: 
Description:: Need a pair of dice for one of the thousands of game that require 2 six sided dice? Let your Yoto do the work for you! 

All possible combinations are included, and the dice are added after each roll. Rolls are random and go on forever! These dice are for anyone but they will allow young children, those who have trouble with small dice or seeing the numbers to play together.

To roll again, take the card out and reinsert it.
