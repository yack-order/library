Title:: The Pencil (Digital)
Author:: Susan Avingaq and Maren Vsetula
Description:: Susan and her sister, Rebecca, love watching their mother write letters to people in other camps. Their mother has one precious pencil, and she keeps it safe in her box for special things. One afternoon, their mother leaves the iglu to help a neighbour, and Susan, Rebecca, and their brother Peter are left with their father. They play all their regular games but are soon out of things to do—until their father brings out the pencil! 

As Susan draws and draws, the pencil grows shorter and shorter. What will their mother think when she comes home? 

Based on author Susan Avingaq’s childhood memories of growing up in an iglu, this charming story introduces young readers to the idea of using things wisely.

This digital card includes both an English and an Inuktitut language version of the story.
