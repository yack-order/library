Description:: Brought to you by Pottermore 

Quidditch Through the Ages has always been one of the most popular books in the Hogwarts library. This is the essential guide to the wizarding world's favourite game. Charting its journey from Queerditch Marsh in the eleventh century to the sophisticated sport of today, Quidditch Through the Ages will show you the moments of exhilarating triumph and crushing despair (such as supporting the Chudley Cannons) that are part of the game of Quidditch. Learn all about the history and rules of the game, from some of the 700 fouls (and which World Cup Final saw all of them committed) to the difference between a Transylvanian Tackle and a Woollongong Shimmy. The shelves of the Hogwarts Library are also home to many more fascinating books. 

If you have enjoyed Quidditch Through the Ages you might want to check out some of its other treasures: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and The Tales of Beedle the Bard.
