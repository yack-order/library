Good evening. Talking parrots in the rooftops? A giant cactus on the high street? Mosquitoes so nasty that even their own friends don’t like them? Something’s gone terribly wrong in Lamonic Bibber… and Mr Gum is nowhere to be found.

Yes, folks, Polly and Friday are facing their biggest challenge yet. So strap yourselves in, cry ‘HI-HO-WEIRDY!’ and get ready for an adventure so crazy your feet will melt with happiness! And I’m not just saying that, I’ve actually seen it happen. HOORAY!
