Title:: Mindfulness for Children
Author:: Ladybird
Description:: A practical and interactive audiobook for 5 to 7 year olds. This collection of 20 interactive exercises will teach children the basics of practicing mindfulness - while also making it fun and accessible! Written by a leading child development psychologist and mindfulness expert, and brought to life with fun sound effects, we learn about calming, focus, bedtime, waking up and kindness. Your child will be encouraged to play along as they listen, using their imagination to focus on the here and now. We know little minds can be busy and easily distracted, so you can start by doing as little as one minute at a time. Once this is established you can then build up to two, three and five minutes. Whatever your child's personality, these breathing exercises, visualisations, calming games and meditations will help them manage worries, encourage focus and kindness and make bedtime and waking up that bit more fun.
