Title:: Let's Move - An Animal Dance
Author:: Yoto
Description:: Giraffe, Kangaroo and Polar Bear are learning to dance but can’t agree on who amongst them has the best moves. They turn to their friends who each want to show them their best dance moves too! They start to put each of the animal moves together and realise that the best dance is when they use a little bit of everyone’s moves. Join the ultimate animal dance!

This card encourages kids to do animal movements and learn simple choreography.
