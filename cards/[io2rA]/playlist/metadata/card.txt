Title:: Mindful Musicians: Green Album
Author:: Mindful Musicians
Description:: The Mindful Musicians Green Album covers the following topics: Resiliency, Coping Skills, Perspective, Inclusion, Boundaries, Self-Care, and Relationships. The inspiration for our music stems from the idea that a positive development of self love is the answer to a successful life. Our goal is to use the simplicity of musical enjoyment to offer children an opportunity to hear about brain health topics from an early age. 

These songs offer ways to provide children support by offering them tools that they can use throughout their lives. Our music is inspired by real life scenarios of childhood adversities and parenting obstacles that challenge resilience, encourage exploration and acceptance of self, and remind us that the most important part of this entire journey is to enjoy it.
