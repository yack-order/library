Description:: If you are looking for a no nonsense way to get started with Make Your Own on Yoto, you are in the right place. 

This is the first in a series of short activities, each set in the form of a simple challenge that will take you through one of the basic steps to get started with Make Your Own.

Grownups, you can do these on your own, or you can do them as an activity with slightly older kids. And by the end, youâ€™ll be a Make Your Own master, or something like that!
