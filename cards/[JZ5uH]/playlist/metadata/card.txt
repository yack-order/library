Title:: Kirthar National Park
Author:: Yoto
Description:: Kirthar National Park is home to an astounding array of animal life, some of whom lend their voices to this gentle outdoor ambiance. Over a blanket of chirping crickets, some of the parkâ€™s 58 bird species chortle peacefully as the sun sets. The perfect evening soundtrack.
