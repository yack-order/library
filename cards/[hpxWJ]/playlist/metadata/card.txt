Title:: Kensy and Max 4: Out of Sight
Author:: Jacqueline Harvey
Description:: When does a secret become a lie? And how do you tell right from wrong when deception is all around you? Kensy and Max are gearing up for their first Pharos review, a rite of passage with no room for failure. But juggling studies and the spy life isn't without its complications. As the dust settles from their last mission, and family members find their place in the new world order, old tensions rise to the surface. There's also the school play to prepare for - in rather different ways for each twin. However, the play soon takes a back seat as missing journalists and stolen objects see Kensy and Max embarking on a hair-raising ride to the City of Lights. Will they make it before it's too late?
