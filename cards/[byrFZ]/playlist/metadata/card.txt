Title:: Mr Gum and the Goblins
Author:: Andy Stanton
Description:: The third barking bonkers Mr Gum story, read by author Andy Stanton with music and sound effects. A fantastic book for boys and girls aged 7-10 years old.

Good evening, brave listener. But are you brave enough to join Polly and Friday as they climb Goblin Mountain to battle the forces of evil?

For be warned. This audiobook is full of swords and trolls and witches and a thing that looks like a gherkin. And somehow that old roo-de-lally Mr Gum is all mixed up in it too. Shabba me whiskers, it’s a burpin’ epic!
