Title:: Helping Out
Author:: B Major/Yoto
Description:: From the Emmy-nominated team that brought you the Paw Patrol theme song comes this brand new album created just for Yoto! 

Featuring imaginative jingles designed to get kids moving, exploring and considering others, this album is the perfect childhood companion. It introduces listeners to a whole range of practical and social skills - from tidying their rooms, to listening to parents, to learning how to share and be an all-round great friend. They’ll even be encouraged to try out new foods, explore the great outdoors and learn when it’s time to take a break and rest. (Is there anything this Card can’t do?)
