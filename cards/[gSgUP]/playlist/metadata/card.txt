 Read by Tom Felton, this is the electrifying new adventure from bestselling author of The Christmasaurus and The Creakers, Tom Fletcher.
 
 Franky can't wait to move to his new town - although he wishes he didn't have to leave his best friend Dani behind. 
 
 But everything changes after the storm, when strange green lightning and powerful thunder crash down on the town. From that night on, the kids who live on Franky's street start to change. One by one, they become a little odd. A little unusual. A little... magical.

 And so the Danger Gang is born...
