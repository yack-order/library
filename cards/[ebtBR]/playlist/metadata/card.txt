Author:: Clementine
Description:: Meet the Clementine Sleep Cards! They're like magical bedtime friends for kids who sometimes find it tricky to fall asleep or stay asleep. These special cards are here to do two awesome things: first, they help little ones to fall asleep in the coziest way ever.

She is like a sleep superhero with a brainy background in how our brains work. So, when little one’s use the Clementine Sleep Cards, they’ll have the power to dream sweet dreams and be a pro at handling all their thoughts and feelings. Sweet dreams, little ones!
