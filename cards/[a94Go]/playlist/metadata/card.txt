Title:: The Ministry of Unladylike Activity
Author:: Robin Stevens
Description:: Brought to you by Puffin.  

Britain is at war, and a secret arm of the British government called the Ministry of Unladylike Activity is training up spies. And who better to become a spy than a child? A child can go places, see things and listen in on conversations in a way that no adult ever can.

And then the murder happens...
