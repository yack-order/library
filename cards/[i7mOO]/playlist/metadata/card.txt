Title:: Ada Twist, Scientist
Author:: Andrea Beaty
Description:: Like her classmates, builder Iggy and inventor Rosie, scientist Ada, a character of color, has a boundless imagination and has always been hopelessly curious. 

Why are there pointy things stuck to a rose? 

Why are there hairs growing inside your nose? 

When her house fills with a horrific, toe-curling smell, Ada knows it's up to her to find the source. Not afraid of failure, she embarks on a fact-finding mission and conducts scientific experiments, all in the name of discovery. 

But, this time, her experiments lead to even more stink and get her into trouble! Although Ada may never find the source, she's able to indulge her curiosity in the ways a young scientist should.
