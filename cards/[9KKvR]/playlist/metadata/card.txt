Title:: Nora And The Compass Of Chaos
Author:: Joseph Elliott
Description:: The side-splittingly funny sequel to Nora and the Map of Mayhem by award-winning author Joseph Elliott, star of CBeebies' Swashbuckle.  

When Nora is invited to a fancy dress party, she thinks that's the worst of her problems . . . until she discovers her friend Grizzler is missing. After finding his boat completely wrecked, Nora sets off on a wild adventure to try and find him - though she doesn't expect her great-grandkids, Atticus and Autumn, to have stowed away for the ride!  

Between dodging fingernail-eating skuttlecrags and wrangling ice-breathing jujugars, there's also whispers of a rogue Monster Hunter on the loose with monstrous plans in motion. With only some wool, a corkscrew and half a pack of sweets in their possession, can the trio stop the true villain before it's too late?
