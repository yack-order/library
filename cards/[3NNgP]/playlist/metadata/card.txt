Title:: Sweetest Kulu (Digital)
Author:: Celina Kalluk
Description:: "Dream a little, Kulu, this world now sings a most beautiful song of you."

 This beautiful bedtime poem, written by acclaimed Inuit throat singer Celina Kalluk, describes the gifts given to a newborn baby by all the animals of the Arctic. 

 Lyrically and tenderly told by a mother speaking to her own little Kulu; an Inuktitut term of endearment often bestowed upon babies and young children, this story is infused with the traditional Inuit values of love and respect for the land and its animal inhabitants.

This digital card includes both an English and an Inuktitut language version of the story.
