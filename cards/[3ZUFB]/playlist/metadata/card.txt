Title:: Fearless Fairy Tales
Author:: James Kay and Konnie Huq
Description:: Fearless Fairy Tales is a hilarious and anarchic collection of classic bedtime stories for young listeners, all utterly updated for a new generation. 

Meet Trumplestiltskin, a vain and gold-obsessed little man who will stop at nothing to become richer and richer. There's Sleeping Brainy, the princess whose only dream is to become Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Gingerbread Kid, who escapes persecution in his home country but struggles to fit in in his new one. You won't forget the lingering stench of Mouldysocks - a boy obsessed with staring at his iPad but rather less obsessed with personal hygiene - and you'll be rooting for Rap-Unzel when she gets the chance of fame by appearing on Kingdom's Got Talent...but at what cost?
