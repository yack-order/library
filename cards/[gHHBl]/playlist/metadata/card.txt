Title:: The Good Turn
Author:: Sharna Jackson
Description:: From the award-winning author of High Rise Mystery. 

A sharp, funny middle-grade adventure with themes of real-life activism and how to help others for fans of The Goonies and The London Eye Mystery.

Josephine Williams is a future-focused, internet-loving 11-year-old who is desperate to explore the world beyond her cul-de-sac—and her browser.

When she learns about Josephine Holloway—a woman who started the first Girl Scout Troop for Black girls in America—she's certain she must start her own.

Enlisting her friends Margot Anderson and Wesley Evans, the trio begin their quest for their Camping Badge. Drawn to an abandoned factory nearby, they stumble across something strange. An ancient square television and two tatty armchairs. Beside it, a wooden sideboard with an old photograph of a happy young couple.

What is this? Who, or what, lives here—and why?
