Description:: Divinity Roxx is an American recording artist, composer, and musician. In addition to her own work, she is well known for touring and performing with Beyoncé Knowles (2006–2011) as her bassist and Musical Director. 

'Ready Set Go' is her latest family-focused album. These tunes are equal parts fun and empowering and encourage kids to prepare themselves for greatness from the moment the day begins.
