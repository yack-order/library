Title:: American Girl: WellieWishers: The Princesses and the Dragon
Author:: Valerie Tripp
Description:: “Let’s pretend we live in a castle,” says Emerson. The five WellieWishers have great fun in the castle until one day, a grumpy dragon appears outside! The girls try wishes and spells to make the dragon go away. Then Willa, who understands all animals, points out that there’s one thing they haven’t tried. But will it work? This story tells about the power of make-believe and how getting a new point of view can make all the difference. Includes ideas for fun activities that girls and parents can do together.
