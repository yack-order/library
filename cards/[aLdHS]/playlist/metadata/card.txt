Author:: Ranger Rae and the Wildlifers | National Trust Kids' Podcast
Description:: Follow the adventures of Ranger Rae and the Wildlifers, a crew of colorful creatures who use their special skills to help where there’s trouble in nature.

Beaver’s a super engineer. Sleepy Bat’s skill is sonar. Wildcat’s a proud predator. Deer’s strong and speedy. Fox has a nose for trouble. Shy Mole’s an expert digger, and Dragonfly’s always buzzing.

Ranger Rae is the leader and can understand animals. And twelve-year-old Apprentice Roxy dreams of becoming a real Ranger and being able to talk to wildlife, too.

In each story, the Wildlifers go on a curious case. They travel to different places in the natural world, from coastlines and remote islands to forests and city streets, and meet a host of weird and wonderful creatures along the way.

Ranger Rae and the Wildlifers is a podcast from the National Trust, produced by Fun Kids Radio.
