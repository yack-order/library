Title:: Those Shoes
Author:: Maribeth Boelts
Description:: All Jeremy wants is a pair of those shoes, the ones everyone at school seems to be wearing. But Jeremy’s grandma tells him they don’t have room for "want," just "need," and what Jeremy needs are new boots for winter. 

When Jeremy’s shoes fall apart at school, and the guidance counselor gives him a hand-me-down pair, the boy is more determined than ever to have those shoes, even a thrift-shop pair that are much too small. 

But sore feet aren’t much fun, and Jeremy comes to realize that the things he has - warm boots, a loving grandma, and the chance to help a friend - are worth more than the things he wants.
