Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is narrated by Sacha Dhawan (Doctor Who, The Boy with the Top Knot), and is bursting with fantabulous sound effects.    

'Did we go too far?' Charlie asked. 'Too far?' cried Mr Wonka. 'Of course we went too far! We've gone into orbit!' WHOOSH! Inside the Great Glass Elevator, Willy Wonka, Charlie Bucket and his family are cruising a thousand feet above the chocolate factory. They can see the whole world below them, but they're not alone. The American Space Hotel has also just launched. Lurking inside are the Vermicious Knids - the most brutal beasts in the universe!    

Can Charlie and Willy Wonka stop them from destroying everything?
