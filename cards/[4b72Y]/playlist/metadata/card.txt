Title:: Nora and the Map of Mayhem
Author:: Joseph Elliott
Description:: An outrageously funny new children's book from award-winning author Joseph Elliott, star of CBeebies' Swashbuckle and CBBC's Big Fat Like.  

When Atticus and Autumn's dads leave them with their eccentric great-grandmother Nora for the weekend, they're hoping for a few days scoffing biscuits and playing video games. But when Nora's around, nothing ever goes quite to plan...       

After a stranger from Nora's past leaves a menacing note pinned to her front door, Atticus and Autumn are swept away on a hair-raising adventure dodging snot-flinging sea monsters, battling thunderous electrosquibs and trying to escape from a very flappy goose!
