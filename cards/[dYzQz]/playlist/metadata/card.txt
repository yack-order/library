Title:: When You Can Swim
Author:: Jack Wong
Description:: In expansive vignettes, we meet sandpipers, tannin-soaked lakes, and the feeling of a small waterfall on one’s shoulders. Artist and author Jack Wong has delivered an empowering, poetic, modern classic that fills readers with the wonder and confidence needed to overcome their fears of the water. When You Can Swim invites children into the warmth and wonder of the natural world and its watery splendors. At the same time, children will experience the joyousness that nature’s lessons teach us through its beauty.
