From the Creator:   “If you could pull a hair out of your body that was stronger than steel, what would you use it for? What if that hairlike fiber was also tougher than kevlar and more flexible than nylon?   You wouldn't use it only for trapping food for dinner, and neither does a spider. Scientists have worked for years and spent millions of dollars trying to reproduce spider silk — the thin, flexible fiber that a spider can simply pull out of its abdomen. Spiders build webs in shapes you’ve never seen before. They have also evolved to use their silk in all sorts of devious, delightful, creepy, and captivating ways.”
