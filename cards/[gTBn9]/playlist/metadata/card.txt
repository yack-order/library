Title:: Henry and the Paper Route
Author:: Beverly Cleary
Description:: Newbery Medal-winning author Beverly Cleary gives readers a hero they'll relate to--and root for--in this comical and inspiring novel about Henry Huggins's mission to prove himself worthy of his very own paper route.

All the older kids work their own paper route, but because Henry is not quite eleven yet, Mr. Capper won't let him. Desperate to change his dad's mind, Henry tries everything he can think of to show he's mature and responsible enough for the job. From offering free kittens to new subscribers, to hauling hundreds of pounds of old magazines for his school's paper drive, there's nothing Henry won't try.

But it just might turn out to be the irrepressible Ramona Quimby who shows Mr. Capper how capable Henry is.
