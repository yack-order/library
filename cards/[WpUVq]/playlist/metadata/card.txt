Title:: Little Stories for Little Lions
Author:: Benedict Atkins
Description:: These short stories based on children in the Bible were written by the bedside of my little boy as I helped him feel safe enough to sleep â€” and they worked!

Inspired by what we know from Scripture; with good theology; and playful yet prayerful imagination to fill in some blanks, these stories are designed to soothe and inspire your little ones and, hey, maybe even you too.
