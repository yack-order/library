Title:: My Ten Lives 
Author:: Yoto
Description:: Ever wondered what happens when you recycle your plastic bottles? Follow Poly the Polymer (and her new friend Zack) on an eco-tastic journey to find out!  

When Zack throws his plastic water bottle into the wrong bin, he doesn’t expect it to jump back out and start talking…   Poly the Polymer has ten lives, and in each one she becomes something just as useful as the last. She’ll hold flowers as a pretty flower pot, protect Zack from the rain as a waterproof raincoat, help him run as fast as he can and even blast off into space! Just tap the button on your player to discover what Poly will become next.  

Complete with immersive sound effects, educational facts, planet-saving tips and an important ecological message, this round-the world adventure will leave you in awe of just how amazing recycling can be.
