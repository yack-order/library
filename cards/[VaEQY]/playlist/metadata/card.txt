Title:: Nighttime on the Farm
Author:: Yoto & The LEGO Group
Description:: "It’s time for bed, so say goodnight, at the end of another day. It’s time to sleep, so snuggle down, tomorrow we’ll get to play!”

Auntie Kate needs help getting her LEGOⓇ DUPLOⓇ farm animals to sleep! Luckily, The Farmyard Helpers Theo and Lola are on the job. 

Join them as they tuck all the animals into bed for the night, from rounding up the fluffy sheep to getting the chickens into their coop. Soon the only sound on the busy farm is snoring!
