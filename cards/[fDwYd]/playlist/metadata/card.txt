Title:: Narwhal's Sweet Tooth
Author:: Ben Clanton
Description:: Everyone knows that Narwhal is a big fan of sugary treats — but Jelly is shocked when Narwhal’s tusk-tooth isn’t looking so pearly white anymore and is feeling a little funny.  

It turns out, Narwhal has been using it as a “snack saver”! Thankfully, no one knows more about dental hygiene than Shark — she has seven rows of teeth, after all! Meanwhile, Jelly and Crab try to show Narwhal that it’s fine to frown if you’re feeling down. Can Narwhal’s friends convince the happiest creature in the ocean that it’s okay to have a bad day?
