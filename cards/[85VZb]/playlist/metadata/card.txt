Title:: Charlie Turns into a T-Rex
Author:: Sam Copeland
Description:: Brought to you by Puffin.   

When dad's business takes a sudden turn for the worse, the McGuffin family face the terrible prospect of having to sell their house and move in with Aunt Brenda and her seventeen cats (and wooden leg).   

Only Charlie and best friends Flora, Mohsen and Wogan can save the day. If they can break into the fortress-like offices of Van Der Gruyne Industries and recover the McGuffins' stolen gold, maybe Charlie won't have to move away after all.   

Trouble is, the pressure is getting to Charlie, making it harder for him to control when he changes into an animal - and harder still to change back. Can Charlie's friends help him master his powers once and for all, or will he end up stuck as a pigeon forever . . . ?  

The second book in this middle grade series perfect for David Walliams fans is a hilarious blend of humour and heart.
