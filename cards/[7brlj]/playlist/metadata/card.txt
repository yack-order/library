Title:: The Hodgeheg and Other Stories
Author:: Dick King-Smith
Description:: Puffin presents eight stories from master storyteller, Dick King-Smith.
 
This collection features one of Dick King-Smith's most loved characters, The Hodgeheg.
 Max is a hedgehog who lives with his family in a nice little home, but it's on the wrong side of the road from the Park where there's a beautiful lily pond and plenty of juicy slugs, worms and snails!
  
  The busy road is dangerous but Max is determined to make his way across. If humans can do it, why can't hedgehogs? His first attempt ends in a nasty bump on the head and, when Max tries to speak, he realises his words are all mixed up. He is no longer a hedgehog but a hodgeheg!
  
  Still determined to fulfil his mission, Max discovers the best way to cross the road - with the help of the lollipop lady and some careful detective work . . .
 
 The other brilliant stories featured this collection are: Poppet, E.S.P, The Mousebutcher, The Merrythought, Lightning Strikes Twice, A Narrow Squeak and Under the MishMash Trees.
