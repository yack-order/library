Title:: Bear Country: Bearly a Misadventure
Author:: Doreen Cronin
Description:: The Chicken Squad is back for their sixth (mis)adventure, and this time there's a headless bear on the loose and the Chicken Squad's beloved Barbara has gone missing! A "lip-bitingly funny" (School Library Journal) chapter book from the bestselling author of Click, Clack, Moo and Cyclone. It's fall in the backyard, and though the weather is cooling down, the crime solving business is still hot. When the Chicken Squad's neighbor Anna McClanahanahan comes looking for her missing hamster one morning, it's an easy case to solve (Ziggy always takes a stroll from 6:30 to 7:15 a.m.). The Chicken Squad is now ready to settle in for a relaxing day of knitting-that is, until Ziggy points out that Barbara, the Chicken Squad's caretaker-the one who FEEDS THEM!!-is missing! And not only that, but there have been sightings of a headless bear in the neighborhood! Will the Chicken Squad be able to save their beloved Barbara and get some breakfast? Or will this case be too much to bear?
