Title:: Moon! Earth's Best Friend: Our Universe, Book 3
Author:: Stacy McAnulty
Description:: From writer Stacy McAnulty and illustrator Stevie Lewis, Moon! Earth's Best Friend is a light-hearted nonfiction audiobook about the formation and history of the moon—told from the perspective of the moon itself.

Meet Moon! She's more than just a rock—she’s Earth’s rock, her best friend she can always count on. Moon never turns her back on her friend (literally: she's always facing Earth with the same side!). These two will stick together forever. With characteristic humor and charm, Stacy McAnulty channels the voice of Moon in this next celestial "autobiography" in the Our Universe series.
