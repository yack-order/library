Author:: Zoë Foster Blake & Daniel Gray-Barnett
Description:: Poor Finn is looking forward to drifting off to sleep in his cosy warm bed, when Mummy appears wanting a drink. Finn resettles her and has just fallen asleep, when he’s woken again . . . this time by Daddy, who’s had a bad dream. And so it goes. Just when Finn has one parent back to sleep, the other wakes up! When will these two sleep through the night?
