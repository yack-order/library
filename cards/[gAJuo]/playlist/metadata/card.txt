Description:: The first book in a hilarious chapter book series that tackles anxiety in a fun, kid-friendly way. A humorous and touching series about facing your fears and embracing new experiences — with a truly unforgettable character. Alvin, an Asian American second grader, is afraid of everything — elevators, tunnels, girls, and, most of all, school. He’s so afraid of school that, while he’ s there, he never, ever, says a word. But at home, Alvin is a very loud superhero named Firecracker Man, a brother to Calvin and Anibelly, and a gentleman-in-training, just like his dad. With the help of his family, can Alvin take on the outside world without letting his fears get the best of him?
