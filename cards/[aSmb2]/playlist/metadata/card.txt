Title:: Terrestrials
Author:: Radiolab presents
Description:: Terrestrials is a show for people of all ages that explores the strangeness that exists right here on Earth. 

In each episode, host Lulu Miller (co-host of Radiolab) will introduce you to a creature or earthly phenomenon that will defy your expectations of how nature is supposed to work. Along the way, you'll encounter a chorus of experts, including scientists, surfers, hip hop artists andâ€¦a "Songbud" named Alan (indie punk musician Alan Goffinski) who creates original songs for key moments of confusion, discovery or awe. 

New episodes drop Thursdays. Listen in with your whole family. Or all alone.
