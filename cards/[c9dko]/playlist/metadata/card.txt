Title:: Moshi: Bedtime with Moshi
Author:: Moshi
Description:: Snuggle up with Bobo the Lullaby Llama, Buster Bumblechops, Wuzzle the Wandering Wumple  and more in this collection of 6 stories. 

This panpipe-infused story sees a Lullaby Llama leaving her home in the hilly Sleevies to climb the mountainous Handes, in search of a way to improve her playing. 

Take a tuneful trip to the dreamiest corners of the Moshi world as Buster Bumblechops tells of his quest to find a very special egg. 

Ready, steady, zzzzz. The race is on as a kindly Twilight Tortoise challenges a boastful Bonkers Whizzling to a moonlit marathon across the world of Moshi. 

On your mark, get set, sleep! Experience the quiet and sleepy world of Moshi as you fly along with Jeepers on his magic carpet. This sleepy story explains how a super cute Moshling otter relaxes before bedtime by swimming in his enchanted cavern. 

Hear how Wuzzle the Wandering Wumple floats through an enchanted wood that is festooned with ancient swaying woodchimes, upon his flying lotus leaf.
