Title:: I'm New Here
Author:: Anne Sibley O'Brien
Description:: “We have a new student…” It’s not easy to be the new student in school, but when you are from another country, it can be especially hard to fit in. With a little support and a lot of courage Maria, Jin, and Fatimah overcome the challenges to find their places in their new American classroom. This heartfelt and beautifully rendered message of empathy for the immigrant experience is encouraging for new students as well as important for their classmates.
