Title:: Bright Star/ Lucero
Author:: Yuyi Morales
Description:: Child, you are awake! You are alive! You are a bright star, Inside our hearts. Told with a combination of powerful, spare language and sumptuous and complex imagery that is typical of Yuyi Morales's work, this is the story of a fawn making her way through a border landscape teeming with flora and fauna native to the region. A gentle but empowering voice encourages her to face her fears when she comes across an obstacle in the form of an insurmountable barrier. Perfect for very young children looking for their place in a world full of uncertainty, it is a story that will resonate with many, especially those whose safety is threatened due to the immigration crisis in the US.
