Title:: Before She was Harriet
Author:: Lesa Cline-Ransome
Description:: The inspirational and determined life of Tubman is distilled into evocative vignettes reaching back to her childhood. So varied were her roles that the casting of multiple narrators not only adds texture to the production but helps reinforce that each role had its own set of challenges and its own place in her life. Each of the four narrators reads with a clear, convincing voice and employs tones befitting the role she portrays. Tune into this inspiring read-along now.
