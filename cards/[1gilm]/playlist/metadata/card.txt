Title:: The Jolley-Rogers and the Ghostly Galleon
Author:: Jonny Duddle
Description:: Ahoy there shipmates! Climb aboard with the first in The Jolley-Rogers series. Join Jim Lad and Matilda as they sail the seven seas (and the coast of Dull-on-Sea) in search of adventure and pirate loot.

Every full moon, a mysterious ship is seen off the coast of Dull-on-Sea. Then, the day after, gold and jewellery are missing from the homes, shops and museums of the town. Matilda needs the Jolley-Rogers' help to investigate. Can Matilda and Jim Lad retrieve the stolen booty from the mysterious ship before the moon fades? Or will they end up stuck on board with ghostly pirates until the next full moon?
