Author:: Jacqueline Harvey
Description:: What would you do if you woke up in a strange place? If your whole life changed in the blink of an eye and you had no idea what was going on?    

Twins Kensy and Max Grey’s lives are turned upside down when they are whisked off to London, and discover their parents are missing. As the situation unfolds, so many things don’t add up: their strange new school, the bizarre grannies on their street, the coded messages they keep finding and the feeling that, all around them, adults are keeping secrets . . .    

Things can never go back to the way they were, but the twins are determined to uncover the truth!
