Title:: MYO Guide 5
Author:: 
Description:: For part 5 in this series, we are going to take the audio recording you made in the previous activity and make a playlist from it. 

A playlist is just a series of tracks, saved on the Yoto cloud, that can then be played from the Yoto App, and linked to Yoto Make Your Own cards just like we did earlier.
