The Twits is narrated by comedian, actor and writer, Sara Pascoe, and is bursting with fantabulous sound effects.    

"To pay Mrs Twit back for the worms in his spaghetti, Mr Twit thought up a really clever, nasty trick . . ."    

Mr Twit is a foul and smelly man who always has bits of cornflake and sardine in his beard. Mrs Twit is scheming and sly and always thinking of the next horrible trick to play on her husband. The Twits are so ghastly and evil that they even keep Muggle-Wump the monkey and his family captive in their garden. But not for much longer! The monkeys are planning to trick the terrible Twits so that they can escape and put a stop to the frightful pair once and for all!    

The text in this edition of The Twits was updated in 2022 for young independent readers.
