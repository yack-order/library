Author:: 
Description:: Join Juna the dwarf druid, Bats the kobold bard, and Tyradel the elf rogue in "The Rise of the Beholder," an interactive adventure through the tunnels of Undermountain! Encounter mysterious flora, outsmart cunning thieves, battle monstrous creatures, and confront a pair of wise golden dragons on your search for a magical ring... hidden by the infamous Xanathar!

How this story unfolds is completely up to you. Decide on a class — wizard or fighter — and make choices along the way that will help you to forge your own quest. Play again and again to discover all the hidden secrets lurking below the city of Waterdeep!

PLEASE NOTE: This card requires a Yoto Player or Yoto Mini and a physical Yoto Card to experience this Interactive Story as intended. While tracks will play sequentially in the app, listeners will not be able to make choices and, therefore, will not get the full experience.
