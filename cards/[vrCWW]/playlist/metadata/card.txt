Description:: Blippi & Meekah’s Road Trip follows best friends Blippi and Meekah as they hop in their BlippiMobile, beep, beep! and take a road trip to an awesome adventure driven by their curiosity. Visiting a vrooming Monster Truck Rally, a singing Rainforest and roaring Prehistoric Era to meet dinosaurs, each adventure is packed with interactive sounds, fun facts, songs and games, like “Follow Your Ears” and “What’s Outside Your Window.” When their adventures end, Blippi and Meekah drive back to their Clubhouse, recounting their favorite moments, learnings and discoveries. They had so much fun, they can’t wait to go on another ultimate road trip real soon – with YOU!
