Author:: LifeScore Music
Description:: LifeScore Cards are immersive soundscapes that encourage a calm state of mind. Each card contains an hour-long piece of music (playing in loop)  composed by world-class composers and played by legendary session musicians.  The music is then recomposed and enhanced by LifeScore's Cellular Compositionâ„¢ algorithm and blended with relaxing, high-fidelity field recordings. The result is a soothing musical experience which will help younger listeners to explore their imaginations and what it means to be creative.  

Focus on Creativity evokes an open mindset and encourages creativity through peaceful orchestration.
