Title:: Dungeons & Dragons: Dungeon Academy: No Humans Allowed (Middle Grade Book #1) (Digital)
Author:: Hasbro
Description:: Welcome to Dungeon Academy, where monsters and creatures train for the dark world that awaits just beyond the dungeon walls. But Zellidora "Zelli" Stormclash isn't a monster or a creature. She is something far worse. Zelli is a human. 

Disguised as a minotaur, Zelli keeps to herself and does her work. While in class, Zelli learns of the great human adventurer, Allidora Steelstrike, who oddly resembles her. Could Zelli also be a Steelstrike? Seeking answers to her true lineage, Zelli embarks on a dangerous adventure. But she won't be alone. 

A vegan owlbear, a cowardly kobold, and a shapeshifting mimic will join Zelli on her quest for truth. And who knows, perhaps these monstrous misfits may discover truths of their own...
