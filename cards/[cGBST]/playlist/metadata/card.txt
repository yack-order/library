Title:: Little Badman and the Time-travelling Teacher of Doom (Digital)
Author:: Humza Arshad and Henry White
Description:: Brought to you by Puffin.
 
 Little Badman and friends return in a second hilarious and action-packed adventure.
 
 'You've probably heard of me, right? Little Badman. No? Oh. Well . . . doesn't Matter. You will do one day. I'm gonna be big.'
 
 I'm Humza Khan, the greatest eleven-year-old rapper Eggington ever had. I've also faced deadly alien slugs, killer aunties and double maths.
 
 But now, I (and my best friend Umer I guess) face something even scarier - my dad! He's pretty fed up with us being naughty, so he's sending us away . . . to school.
 
 But this is not ordinary school. This is a special summer school in Pakistan, and man something weird is going on - someone has been messing with time!
 
 I may have to save the world again . . .
