Basic Details
================
Title:: Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters (Book 2)
Author:: Rick Riordan
Description:: Brought to you by Puffin. 
  
Half boy. Half God. ALL Hero.
  
I look like a normal kid. Only there's a difference. Poseidon, God of the Sea is my dad. Which sounds cool, but actually means there is usually someone (or something), somewhere, trying to kill me.
  
Now I live at Camp Half-Blood, with other kids like me. But Camp Half-Blood is a bit different to most summer camps. Instead of toasting marshmallows and singing campfire songs, we battle giant cannibals at dodgeball.
  
 This time, we're under attack, and I need to get my hands on the Golden Fleece or we'll be invaded by monsters. Big ones.
  
  WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PERCY JACKSON:
  · Monsters
  · Greek Gods
  · Laughs (and terrified screams)
