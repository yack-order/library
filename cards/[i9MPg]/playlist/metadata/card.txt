Laurie says: “Food is one of my favorite things to write songs about. In fact, it’s one of my favorite things, period! Whatever foods you like to eat, I hope you’ll find a song in this collection that makes you happy. You may even discover a food you have never tried before!” Laurie Berkner has sold over 1.1 million albums since her start in 1992.
