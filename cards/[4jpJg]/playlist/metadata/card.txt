Title:: The Terrible Two Go Wild
Author:: Mac Barnett and Jory John
Description:: Everyone’s favorite pranksters are at it again! School’s out, and Miles and Niles are running wild in the woods outside town: climbing trees, exploring caves, and, yes, pranking. But these leafy, lazy days of mischief darken when bully Josh Barkin and his cadets from a nearby kids’ boot camp discover the merrymakers—and vow to destroy them. Are our heroes’ sharp minds any match for these hooligans’ hard fists? The latest installment in the witty, on-target series proves once again that, in the hands of the powerless, pranks can be tools of justice—plus, they’re funny.
