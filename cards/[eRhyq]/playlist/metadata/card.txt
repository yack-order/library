Title:: The Witch's Vacuum Cleaner (Digital)
Author:: Terry Pratchett
Description:: Poor Mr Swimble is having a bad day.    

Rabbits are bouncing out of his hat, pigeons are flying out of his jacket and every time he points his finger, something magically appears – cheese sandwiches, socks . . . even a small yellow elephant on wheels!    

It’s becoming a real nuisance – and he’s allergic to rabbits.    

His friends at the Magic Rectangle can’t help, but the mysterious vacuum cleaner he saw that morning may have something to do with it . . .    

Fourteen fantastically funny stories from master storyteller Sir Terry Pratchett, full of food fights, pirates, wizards and crooks!
