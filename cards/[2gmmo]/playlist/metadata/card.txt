Title:: Mini Mindfulness - Mindful Moments
Author:: Yoto
Description:: Introduce mindfulness and meditation to the next generation with Mindful Moments, the first card in Yoto's Mini Mindfulness series. These 10 short mindfulness exercises will leave children (and adults!) feeling calm, relaxed and focused.

You can enjoy these exercises whenever you like, as often as you like! Each one is just a few minutes long, and the audio will pause at the end of each exercise to give you time to enjoy some quiet time to yourself. If you'd like to listen to multiple exercises in one sitting, just tap the right orange button to skip tracks.

Mindful Moments was created exclusively by Yoto with Louise Gordon, a yoga teacher from Scotland who specialises in Vinyasa and Ashtanga yoga. Louise is also a certified Girlvana teacher and regularly coaches teens and young women in the principals of yoga, mindfulness and wellbeing.
