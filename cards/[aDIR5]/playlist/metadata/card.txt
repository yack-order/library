Title:: Meditate with Me
Author:: Mariam Gates
Description:: This accessible and fun guide to meditation and mindfulness is the perfect introduction for young children.

Meditation does a body good and can even help kids as young as four or five. This practical guide is gentle, clear, and a pleasure to use. Kids will learn how to focus on their breath, on the sensations in their body, and on the sounds around them to help them relax, settle their busy minds, and understand their emotions. Narrated by author Mariam Gates, the audiobook offers step-by-step directions and a repeating refrain:

""Breathe in, and fill your whole body. Breathe out, and relax your whole body.""

It's an invigorating first experience of mindfulness that can be shared by parents and children at home or by teachers and students in the classroom.
