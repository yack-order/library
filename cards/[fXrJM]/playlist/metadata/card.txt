Title:: Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw
Author:: Jeff Kinney
Description:: You know how you're supposed to come up with a list of resolutions at the beginning of the year to try to make yourself a better person? Well, the problem is, it's not easy for me to think of ways to improve myself, because I'm pretty much one of the best people I know. But Greg's dad has other ideas. He wants Greg to change his wimpy ways, toughen up and enlist in other 'manly' endeavours. And when he threatens to send Greg to military academy, Greg realises he has to shape up...or get shipped out..
